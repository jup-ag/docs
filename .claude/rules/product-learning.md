# Product Learnings

Single source of truth for product-specific knowledge that isn't (or shouldn't be)
in the docs themselves. This file accumulates institutional knowledge that prevents
Claude from writing incorrect content or making wrong assumptions.

**When to add an entry:** You discovered something non-obvious about a product —
through debugging, user feedback, reading source code, Discord, or trial and error —
and a future session would benefit from knowing it.

**Format:** Every entry is a dated bullet under the appropriate heading.
Keep entries concise — one line if possible, a short paragraph if needed.
