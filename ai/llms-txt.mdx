llmsDescription: "Jupiter provides two LLM-optimized documentation files: llms.txt (the perfect entrypoint for LLMs and AI agents to get started), structured Markdown index of all APIs, guides, and resources with titles and descriptions) and llms-full.txt (the complete documentation site content including all code examples). Both follow the llmstxt.org standard. Additionally, any documentation page can be accessed as raw markdown by appending .md to the URL or using the Accept: text/markdown header."

Jupiter provides structured documentation files purpose-built for LLMs and AI agents, following the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) standard.

## llms.txt

A plain Markdown file containing a structured index of all Jupiter documentation with titles and descriptions for each page:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading
- **Sections** for each major area (Docs, API References, Guides, Tool Kits, etc)
- **Links with descriptions** for every page

```mdx
# Jupiter

## Docs

- [Build with Jupiter](https://dev.jup.ag/index.md)
- [Get Started](https://dev.jup.ag/get-started/index.md): Welcome to Jupiter's Developer Docs...
- [Overview](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/index.md): Overview of Ultra Swap and its features.
- [API Reference](https://dev.jup.ag/api-reference/index.md): Overview of Jupiter API Reference
```

This is the perfect entrypoint for LLMs and AI agents to get started. It allows them to efficiently locate relevant content at a high level without processing the entire documentation.

## llms-full.txt

<Card title="llms-full.txt" href="https://dev.jup.ag/llms-full.txt" icon="file" horizontal>
  Open the llms-full.txt for Jupiter docs
</Card>

While `llms.txt` provides a concise index, `llms-full.txt` contains the **entire documentation site** as context — including every description, code example, and parameter detail.

Use `llms-full.txt` when:

- Your AI tool needs **complete, granular context** for deep indexing
- You're building **custom RAG pipelines** over Jupiter docs
- You want **every code example** available for reference

## Markdown Export

Any documentation page can be accessed as raw markdown, making it easy for AI agents to consume individual pages programmatically.

**Method 1: Append `.md` to the URL**

```bash
curl https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra.md
curl https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/get-started.md
```

**Method 2: Use the `Accept` header**

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra
```

Both methods return the page content as `text/markdown`.

## How It's Generated

Jupiter's `llms.txt` is auto-generated from the documentation structure. Every page includes an `llmsDescription` field in its frontmatter — a description specifically optimized for LLM consumption, separate from the human-readable description. This ensures AI tools get the most relevant context for each page.
