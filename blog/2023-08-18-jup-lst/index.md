# Unlocking The Potential Of LSTs With The Sanctum Integration

![Sanctum](sanctum.gif)

To maximize the adoption of LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) by users and protocols, we've integrated [Sanctum](https://www.sanctum.so/) into our routing system. This allows users to swap seamlessly between xSOL and SOL at the best possible rates across all markets, regardless of trade amount.

This integration coincides with the formal launch of Sanctum and its reserve pool, which has over 200K SOL. This means large amounts of xSOL can be immediately swapped for tokens like USDC.

LSTs have always had great potential for use by both users and DeFi protocols as a valuable source of yield. However, they've been held back from mass adoption due to the inability to instantly liquidate large amounts of LSTs. Typically, there's a wait to unstake, and there isn't enough liquidity in standard markets.

With this launch and integration, many of these problems are addressed for the foreseeable future. Jupiter’s integration with Sanctum enables users to stake, unstake, and swap LSTs within its routing seamlessly.

Liquidators can now also run liquidations more efficiently with bigger pools of liquidity, using Jupiter’s liquidity routing, including Sanctum’s SOL reserve pool and other markets. This ensures minimal price impact and slippage regardless of trade size.

Besides being a strong source of reassurance for LST holders, this integration also removes the most significant barrier to LST adoption in DeFi.

The integration provides deep liquidity for both existing and new LSTs, eliminating the need for liquidity bootstrapping. This accelerates LST adoption, broadening Solana's tradable assets and potentially unlocking $9B in staked DeFi capital.

This is significant for the Solana ecosystem as it paves the way for protocols to optimize their capital efficiency and yield without typical constraints. We're excited about the innovative products to come from this foundation and delighted to have worked with the amazing Sanctum team on this integration!
