![Sample Blog Post](/static/blog/sample-post/sample-post.png)

This is a sample blog post to help you understand the structure and format for creating new blog posts on the Jupiter Developers documentation site.

---

## Understanding the Structure

Blog posts in the Jupiter documentation follow a consistent structure:

1. **Frontmatter**: Metadata at the top of the file
2. **Hero Image**: Main image displayed at the top
3. **Introduction**: Overview paragraph
4. **Content Sections**: Main body with markdown
5. **Conclusion**: Wrap-up and key takeaways

### Frontmatter Fields

The frontmatter includes important metadata:

- `title`: The main title of your post
- `description`: SEO and social media description
- `og:*`: Open Graph tags for social sharing
- `og:image`: Path to your blog post image

---

## Using Components

Jupiter blog posts support special components:

<Card title="Card Component">
Use the Card component to highlight important information, features, or callouts. 
This helps break up the content and draw attention to key points.
</Card>

<Note>
The Note component is perfect for additional context, warnings, or supplementary information 
that doesn't need as much emphasis as a Card.
</Note>

---

## Code Examples

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example: Using Jupiter API
const response = await fetch('https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
```

## Tables and Lists

Tables are great for comparing data:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Ultra Swap | Best execution engine | ✅ Live |
| Lend | Lending and borrowing | ✅ Live |
| Perps | Perpetuals trading | 🚧 Coming Soon |

You can also use lists:

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two
- Bullet point three

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it focused**: Each post should have a clear topic
2. **Use images**: Visual content improves engagement
3. **Add examples**: Code snippets and real-world use cases
4. **Format consistently**: Follow the existing blog post structure
5. **Test locally**: Always preview before submitting
