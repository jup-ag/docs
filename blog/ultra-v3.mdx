# A Technical Deep Dive into Ultra Swap V3

Ultra V3 represents the culmination of months of infrastructure work, algorithm optimization, 
and real-world testing under production load. This release fundamentally changes how we approach 
swap execution, with measurable improvements across every aspect that matters: execution quality, 
pricing accuracy, transaction success rates, landing speed, and MEV protection.

## IronJup: Sub-Second Transaction Landing

IronJup is Jupiter's proprietary transaction landing infrastructure, delivering measurable 
improvements in both speed and security.

### Transaction Landing Latency

Transaction landing latency improved by **50-66%** compared to traditional methods.
| Method               | Blocks     | Latency         |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **IronJup**          | 0-1 block  | ~400ms          |
| **Traditional methods** | 2-3 blocks | ~800ms - 1.2s  |

Why this matters, because every block your transaction waits is an exposure to poorer execution 
quality such as market movement against your position, increased effective slippage, and higher 
risk of MEV extraction opportunities.

### MEV Protection

IronJup routes transactions through our own infrastructure, providing:
- **Complete transaction privacy** until on-chain execution.
- **Reduce frontrunning exposure** - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
- **Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors** - see [sandwiched.me](https://sandwiched.me/sandwiches) 
for MEV analytics.

	Jupiter Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio is significantly lower than others despite 
  higher volume, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts to bring the best execution quality 
  to our users.

  This redundancy ensures optimal performance even when individual methods experience degraded 
  service, contributing to our 96% success rate.

## Just-In-Time Simulation to Verify Executable Price

A problem that is often overlooked is the lack of comparison between **Quoted Price versus Executed 
Price**. When a quote is provided, it does not necessarily represent the actual executable price and 
quality.

### Executed Price versus Quoted Price

In today's Solana DeFi landscape dominated by proprietary AMMs, these two numbers are increasingly 
divergent. Consider this scenario:

| Route                | Quoted Amount | Executed Amount | Slippage (Amount) | Slippage (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Route A (Traditional AMM)** | 100 tokens    | 80 tokens       | 20 tokens        | 20%         |
| **Route B (Prop AMM)**        | 150 tokens    | 50 tokens       | 100 tokens       | 66%         |


Route B shows a 50% better quote, but Route A delivers 60% more tokens to your wallet. This is why 
quote comparison between platforms is fundamentally misleading - but we have made significant 
improvements to our routing engine to ensure that the provided quotes have verifiable executable 
prices.

### Just-In-Time Simulation

Ultra V3 introduces **Just-In-Time Simulation** for every quote returned by every router we aggregate.

**How it works:**
1. Aggregated routers return their best quotes.
2. Ultra performs on-chain simulation of each route before returning quotes to users.
3. Simulations verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
4. Routes are ranked by simulated outcome, not just quoted price.

**Impact:** Users receive quotes that reflect actual on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case 
scenarios. This shift from quote-optimized to execution-optimized routing is responsible for our 
swap success rate improvement from **85% to ~96%**.

## Slippage Optimization

Since the inception of RTSE (Real-Time Slippage Estimator), we have made strides to improve the 
slippage protection for our users. With Ultra V3, we have implemented the following improvements:

- **Reduced RTSE slippage set** while maintaining high success rates.
- **Automatic prioritization** of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
- **Increased volatility sensitivity** for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

## Just-In-Time Market Revival

Ultra V3 solves a long-standing technical limitation which is to provide routes for tokens that 
have "fallen out of favor" - When markets are have low liquidity or yet to graduate for a long time, 
we downgrade these markets to optimize resource allocation. This makes them unroutable, disallowing 
users to enter or exit their positions.

To address this, we have implemented a Just-In-Time market Revival Mechanism that **dynamically 
re-indexes token markets on-demand.**
- Routes virtually any token on Solana, including extremely long-tail assets.
- Supports old, inactive tokens that historically failed to route.
- Essentially, no minimum liquidity threshold for token eligibility.

<Note>
This behavior is exclusive to Ultra only. Legacy Swap API does not have this capability.
</Note>

## Pre-Graduation Routing Optimization

To further enhance the trading experience for trenchers, we have optimized Pump.fun pre-graduation
routing logic by skipping multi-route aggregation to reduce the quote latency by 90%+ for 
pre-graduated Pump.fun tokens:

|        | Average Quote Latency | Routing Method                    |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Before | 200ms                | Checking multiple potential routes |
| After  | 10-15ms              | Direct routing to Pump.fun           |

## Gasless Support Coverage

With Ultra V3, we have expanded gasless support coverage to Token2022 tokens, memecoin-to-memecoin 
swaps (when liquidity permits), and reduced minimum trade size to ~$10 USD. We will continue to 
improve this over time.

## Jupiter Ultra Fee Structure

We have the best quoting, routing, and execution infrastructure, yet Jupiter Ultra fee remains 
competitive and transparent.

| Provider          | Fee (bps)                | Example Fee on $10,000 Trade | Notes                                           |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Jupiter Ultra** | 0 - 10                   | `$0 – $10`                   | 10x cheaper   |
| **Competitors**   | At least 85 - 100 (≥ 1%) | `$85 – $100`                 | Typically at least 1%; costs compound over time |

## Summary

Ultra is more than just a swap - it's an abstraction layer over the challenges of execution and 
blockchain complexity:

**For end users:** No need to understand slippage settings, gas fees, RPC selection, or MEV 
protection. Ultra handles everything.

**For developers:** The exact same Ultra infrastructure that powers jup.ag's UI is also available 
to developers via API. No need to build, host, or maintain your own RPC, transaction landing 
infrastructure and manage other trading optimizations. For more information, please refer to 
the [Ultra Swap docs](/docs/ultra).

Ultra V3 demonstrates that the best execution isn't about finding the best quote - it's about 
delivering the best outcome. Through rigorous measurement, continuous optimization, and proprietary 
infrastructure, we've built a system that consistently outperforms on the metrics that actually 
matter - the data speaks for itself.
