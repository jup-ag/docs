![Ultra Swap V3](/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png)

Ultra V3 represents the culmination of months of infrastructure work, algorithm optimization, 
and real-world testing under production load. This release fundamentally changes how we approach 
swap execution, with measurable improvements across every aspect that matters:

## Sub-Second Transaction Landing

IronJup is Jupiter’s proprietary transaction landing infrastructure, designed for measurable 
improvements in both speed and reliability.

### Transaction Landing Latency

Transaction landing latency has improved by **50–66%** compared with our previous approach that 
relied on multiple providers.

| Method               | Blocks     | Latency         |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **IronJup**          | 0-1 block  | ~ 50ms - 400ms    |
| **Traditional methods** | 1-3 blocks | ~ 400ms - 1.2s  |

Every block your transaction waits is an exposure to poorer execution quality, such as market 
movement against your position, increased effective slippage, and a higher risk of MEV extraction 
opportunities.

With IronJup we now leverage our own validator stake and dedicated R&D efforts, IronJup consistently 
processes transactions within 50–400 ms and by operating entirely on our own infrastructure instead 
of relying on external providers, we eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring 
faster and more secure execution for our users.

### MEV Protection

IronJup routes transactions through our own infrastructure, providing:
- **Complete transaction privacy** until on-chain execution.
- **Reduce frontrunning exposure** - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
- **Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors** - see [sandwiched.me](https://sandwiched.me/sandwiches) 
for MEV analytics.

	Jupiter Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio is significantly lower than others despite 
  higher volume, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts to bring the best execution quality 
  to our users.

  This redundancy ensures optimal performance even when individual methods experience degraded 
  service, contributing to our 96% success rate.

## Just-In-Time Quote Simulation

A problem that is often overlooked is the lack of comparison between **Quoted Price versus Executed 
Price**. When a quote is provided, it does not necessarily represent the actual executable price and 
quality.

### Executed Price versus Quoted Price

In today's Solana DeFi landscape dominated by proprietary AMMs, these two numbers are increasingly 
divergent. Consider this scenario:

| Route                | Quoted Amount | Executed Amount | Slippage (Amount) | Slippage (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Route A (Traditional AMM)** | 100 tokens    | 80 tokens       | 20 tokens        | 20%         |
| **Route B (Prop AMM)**        | 150 tokens    | 50 tokens       | 100 tokens       | 66%         |


Route B shows a 50% better quote, but Route A delivers 60% more tokens to your wallet. This is why 
quote comparison between platforms is fundamentally misleading - but we have made significant 
improvements to our routing engine to ensure that the provided quotes have verifiable executable 
prices.

### Verifiable Executable Price

Ultra V3 introduces **Just-In-Time Simulation** for every quote returned by every router we aggregate.

**How it works:**
1. Aggregated routers return their best quotes.
2. Ultra performs on-chain simulation of each route before returning quotes to users.
3. Simulations verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
4. Routes are ranked by simulated outcome, not just quoted price.

**Impact:** Users receive quotes that reflect actual on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case 
scenarios. This shift from quote-optimized to execution-optimized routing is responsible for our 
swap success rate improvement from **85% to ~96%**.

## Just-In-Time Market Revival

Ultra V3 solves a long-standing technical limitation which is to provide routes for tokens that 
have "fallen out of favor" - When markets have low liquidity or yet to graduate for a long time, 
we downgrade these markets to optimize resource allocation. This makes them unroutable, preventing 
users to enter or exit their positions.

To address this, we have implemented a Just-In-Time market Revival Mechanism that **dynamically 
re-indexes token markets on-demand.**
- Routes virtually any token on Solana, including extremely long-tail assets.
- Supports old, inactive tokens that historically failed to route.
- Essentially, no minimum liquidity threshold for token eligibility.

<Note>
This behavior is exclusive to Ultra only. Legacy Swap API does not have this capability.
</Note>

## Pre-Graduation Routing Latency Reduction

To further enhance the trading experience for trenchers, we have optimized the routing logic for 
all pre-graduated bonding curve markets by skipping multi-route aggregation to reduce the quote 
latency by 90%+:

|        | Average Quote Latency | Routing Method                    |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Before | 200ms                | Checking multiple potential routes |
| After  | 10-15ms              | Direct routing to pre-graduated markets |

## Slippage Optimization

Since the inception of RTSE (Real-Time Slippage Estimator), we have made strides to improve the 
slippage protection for our users. With Ultra V3, we have implemented the following improvements:

- **Tighter RTSE slippage heuristics** while maintaining high success rates.
- **Automatic prioritization** of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
- **Increased volatility sensitivity** for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

## Gasless Support Coverage

With Ultra V3, we have expanded gasless support coverage to Token2022 tokens, memecoin-to-memecoin 
swaps (when liquidity permits), and reduced minimum trade size to ~$10 USD. We will continue to 
improve this over time.

## Jupiter Ultra Fee Structure

We have the best quoting, routing, and execution infrastructure, yet Jupiter Ultra fee remains 
competitive and transparent.

| Provider          | Fee (bps)                | Example Fee on $10,000 Trade | Notes                                           |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Jupiter Ultra** | 0 - 10                   | `$0 – $10`                   | 10x cheaper   |
| **Competitors**   | At least 85 - 100 (≥ 1%) | `$85 – $100`                 | Typically at least 1%; costs compound over time |

## Summary

Ultra is more than just a swap - it's an abstraction layer over the challenges of execution and 
blockchain complexity:

**For end users:** No need to understand slippage settings, gas fees, RPC selection, or MEV 
protection. Ultra handles everything.

**For developers:** The exact same Ultra infrastructure that powers jup.ag's UI is also available 
to developers via API. No need to build, host, or maintain your own RPC, transaction landing 
infrastructure and manage other trading optimizations. For more information, please refer to 
the [Ultra Swap Docs](/docs/ultra).

Ultra V3 demonstrates that the best execution isn't about finding the best quote - it's about 
delivering the best outcome. Through rigorous measurement, continuous optimization, and proprietary 
infrastructure, we've built a system that consistently outperforms on the metrics that actually 
matter - the data speaks for itself.
