![Ultra Swap V3](/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png)

Ultra V3 represents the culmination of months of infrastructure work, algorithm optimization, 
and real-world testing under production load. This release fundamentally changes how we approach 
swap execution, with measurable improvements across every aspect that matters:

## Execution-Optimized Predictive Routing

A problem often overlooked is the lack of comparison between **Executed Price versus Quoted Price**. 
When a quote is provided, it does not necessarily represent the actual executable price and quality.

### Executed Price versus Quoted Price

In today's Solana DeFi landscape dominated by proprietary AMMs, these two numbers are increasingly 
divergent. Consider this scenario:

| Route                | Quoted Amount | Executed Amount | Slippage (Amount) | Slippage (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Route A (Traditional AMM)** | 100 tokens    | 80 tokens       | 20 tokens        | 20%         |
| **Route B (Prop AMM)**        | 150 tokens    | 50 tokens       | 100 tokens       | 66%         |

Route B shows a 50% better quote, but Route A delivers 60% more tokens to your wallet. This is why 
quote comparison between platforms is fundamentally misleading - but we have made significant 
improvements to our routing engine to ensure that the provided quotes are executable and have minimal 
slippage.

### Predictive Routing

Ultra V3 introduces **Predictive Routing** for every route before execution:
1. Aggregated routers return their best quotes.
2. Ultra performs on-chain simulation of each route.
3. Simulating quotes on-chain to verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
4. Predicting potential slippage for each route, and dynamically prioritizing the route with the 
least overall incurred slippage at the time of execution.

<Card title="Result">
	Since deployment of Predictive Routing in production, we have seen great results in terms of 
	slippage protection for our users. Using the volume weighted average of the difference between 
	executed slippage and quoted for the past 7 days:
	* Jupiter Ultra on average gave users on average - **positive slippage of +0.63 bps**.
	* Despite market volatility on 11 Oct 2025, we manage to maintain on average - **above negative 
	slippage of -10 bps**

<Card title="Impact">
	Users receive quotes that reflect actual on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. 
	This shift from quote-optimized to execution-optimized routing is responsible for our **swap success 
	rate improvement from 85% to 96%**.

	Jupiter Ultra's swap success rate is on average 96%, but has been battle-tested and proven resilient, 
	maintaining strong performance even during periods of significantly increased market activity and 
	volatility, as demonstrated by the spike in swap volume on October 11th.

## Sub-Second Transaction Landing

Every block your transaction waits, is an exposure to poorer execution quality, such as market 
movement against your position, increased effective slippage, and a higher risk of MEV extraction 
opportunities.

**Meet Hyperlane!** Our in-house transaction landing engine, designed to make every trade faster, 
more private, and more precise.

With Hyperlane, we now leverage our own validator stake and dedicated R&D efforts, Hyperlane consistently 
processes transactions within sub-second latency and by operating entirely on our own infrastructure instead 
of relying on external providers, we eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring 
faster and more secure execution for our users.

### Transaction Landing Latency

<Card title="Result">
	Transaction landing latency has **improved by 50-66%** compared with our previous approach that 
	relied on multiple providers.

	| Method                  | Blocks     | Latency         |
	|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|
	| **Hyperlane**           | 0-1 block  | ~ 50ms - 400ms  |
	| **Traditional methods** | 1-3 blocks | ~ 400ms - 1.2s  |

### MEV Protection

Hyperlane routes transactions through our own infrastructure, providing:
- **Complete transaction privacy** until on-chain execution.
- **Reduce frontrunning exposure** - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
- **Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors** - see [sandwiched.me](https://sandwiched.me/sandwiches) 
for MEV analytics.

<Card title="Result" href="https://sandwiched.me/sandwiches" img="/static/blog/ultra-v3/sandwiched.me-chart.png">
	Jupiter Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio is significantly lower than others despite 
  higher volume, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts to bring the best execution quality 
  to our users.

  This redundancy ensures optimal performance even when individual methods experience degraded 
  service, contributing to our 96% success rate.

## Just-In-Time Market Revival

Ultra V3 solves a long-standing technical limitation which is to provide routes for tokens that 
have "fallen out of favor" - When markets have low liquidity or yet to graduate for a long time, 
we downgrade these markets to optimize resource allocation. This makes them unroutable, preventing 
users to enter or exit their positions.

To address this, we have implemented a Just-In-Time market Revival Mechanism that **dynamically 
re-indexes token markets on-demand**.

<Card title="Impact">
- Routes virtually any token on Solana, including extremely long-tail assets.
- Supports old, inactive tokens that historically failed to route.
- Essentially, no minimum liquidity threshold for token eligibility.
</Card>

## Pre-Graduation Routing Latency Reduction

By default, for all swap pairs, Jupiter Ultra checks for multiple route paths to get the best 
price and execution quality. This adds to quote latency.

To further enhance the trading experience for trenchers, we have optimized the routing logic for 
all pre-graduated bonding curve markets when applicable.

* When the swap pair involves a pre-graduated token and SOL or USDC.
* We skip multi-route aggregation and look for the direct route immediately.

<Card title="Result">
Pre-graduated bonding curve markets routing latency has been **reduced by 90%+**.

|        | Average Quote Latency | Routing Method                          |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Before | 200ms                 | Checking multiple potential routes      |
| After  | 10-15ms               | Direct routing to pre-graduated markets |
</Card>

## Slippage Optimization

Since the inception of RTSE (Real-Time Slippage Estimator), we have made strides to improve the 
slippage protection for our users. With Ultra V3, we have implemented the following improvements:

- **Tighter RTSE slippage heuristics** while maintaining high success rates.
- **Automatic prioritization** of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
- **Increased volatility sensitivity** for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

## Jupiter Ultra Fee Structure

We have the best price, protection, and execution infrastructure, yet Jupiter Ultra fee remains 
competitive and transparent.

|                                                                             | Fee (bps)                | Example fee of a<br/>$10,000-size trade |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Jupiter Ultra is 10x cheaper**.                                           | 0-10                     | `$0 – $10`                              |
| Competitors typically charges at least 1% and costs compound over time. | ≥ 85-100                 | `$85 – $100`                            |

## Summary

Ultra is more than just a swap - it's an abstraction layer over the challenges of execution and 
blockchain complexity:

**For end users:** No need to understand slippage settings, gas fees, RPC selection, or MEV 
protection. Ultra handles everything.

**For developers:** The exact same Ultra infrastructure that powers jup.ag's UI is also available 
to developers via API. No need to build, host, or maintain your own RPC, transaction landing 
infrastructure and manage other trading optimizations. For more information, please refer to 
the [Ultra Swap Docs](/docs/ultra).

<Note>
	All of the improvements mentioned in this blog post are exclusive to Ultra only.  
	They are not present in Legacy Swap API.
</Note>

Ultra V3 demonstrates that the best execution isn't about finding the best quote - it's about 
delivering the best outcome. Through rigorous measurement, continuous optimization, and proprietary 
infrastructure, we've built a system that consistently outperforms on the metrics that actually 
matter - the data speaks for itself.
