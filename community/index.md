### JUP Spirit: Most Vocal, Most Critical, Most Long-Term: 
Our ethos is guided by the [JUP Spirit](/blog/unveiling-the-jup-spirit). We would love to see community-led initiatives that showcase all of that goodness.

Here are some ways to engage: 

** Most Vocal: **
- 📽️  Write articles, make tweet-storms or create videos about Jupiter 
- 🎨  Make art, NFTs and memes that we can use in discord, twitter and blog posts. 
- 🏡  Start a community discussion in our discord  channels

** Most Critical: **
- 🔧  See a bug or areas we can improve? Tell us immediately
- 👀  Participate in ⁠beta-testing and give us your feedback
- ✨  Propose feature improvements

** Most Long Term: **
- 💪  Get projects to integrate us 
- 🙌  Celebrate positive and helpful community members 
- 🐑  Help someone who’s lost. 

We hope to build a Jupiter that belongs to all of us -- from kittens to big cats! ❤️
