Get started by setting up an account on the dashboard to generate API Keys and managing payments via Helio.

Then, to use the API Key in our APIs, simply add the key to the header.

```js
headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': '' // enter api key here
},
```

:::info Free Plan
Do note that you **do not** need an API Key to use the free plan.

Simply just call the endpoints without an API Key at the `lite-api.jup.ag` hostname.

## 1. Open Portal

Navigate to https://portal.jup.ag

## 2. Connect via email

To enter the portal, simply connect via email account. This allows us to keep track of your account tagged to your API Keys.
