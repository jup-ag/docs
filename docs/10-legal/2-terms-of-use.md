### 9. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

*Binding Arbitration*. Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Jupiter: (a) waive the right to have any and all disputes or claims arising from these Terms, your use or access to the Interface or any other disputes with the Jupiter *(collectively, “Disputes”)* resolved in a court; and (b) waive any right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Jupiter agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as described below) through binding arbitration (i.e. the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

*No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions*. You and Jupiter agree that any dispute is personal to you and Jupiter and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and the Jupiter agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other types of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

*Process*. You and the Jupiter agree that each will notify the other, in writing, of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Jupiter shall be provided by sending an email to legal@jup.ag. Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific action that you are seeking. If you and the Jupiter cannot resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the Jupiter receiving the notice, either you or Jupiter may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 9, commence an arbitration proceeding. You and Jupiter agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Jupiter agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute).

*Choice of Law*. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the state of Singapore, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern the Terms and any Dispute between you and us. Any Dispute under these Terms shall be finally settled by Binding Arbitration (as defined below). Any unresolved Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section 9 to the extent they are consistent with it. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in London, United Kingdom, in English, in accordance with the LCIA Arbitration Rules. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent a court therein would be deemed to be a court of competent jurisdiction other than any court located in the United States of America. You further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in the state of Singapore and that, although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the state of Singapore.

*Authority of Arbitrator*. As limited by these Terms and applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

### 10. Miscellaneous

*Changes*. We may amend any portion of these Terms at any time by posting the revised version of these Terms with an updated revision date. The changes will become effective and shall be deemed accepted by you, the first time you use or access the Interface after the initial posting of the revised Terms and shall apply on a going-forward basis with respect to your use of the Interface including any transactions initiated after the posting date. In the event that you do not agree with any such modification, your sole and exclusive remedy are to terminate your use of the Interface.

*Entire Agreement*. These Terms (and any additional terms, rules, and conditions of participation that may be posted on the website of Jupiter) including the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement with respect to the Interface and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written.

*Privacy Policy*. The Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

*Survival*. Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, all rights and obligations of the parties that by their nature are continuing will survive such termination.
