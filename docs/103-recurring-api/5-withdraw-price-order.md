The root URL of the Recurring API's withdraw from price order endpoint is as such.

```
https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/priceWithdraw
```

:::info
This will not close the order. To close the order, you need to use the [`/cancelOrder` endpoint](/docs/recurring-api/cancel-order).

## Withdraw Order

If you want to withdraw funds from a price-based order, you need to do these steps:

1. Get a list of the order accounts you want to withdraw via `/getRecurringOrders` endpoint.
2. Choose the order account to deposit by making a post request to the `/priceDeposit` endpoint to get the transaction to deposit into the order.
3. Sign then send the transaction to the network either via `/execute` endpoint or by yourself.

:::info Get Recurring Orders
[Refer to the `/getRecurringOrders` section](/docs/recurring-api/get-recurring-orders) to prepare order account you want to withdraw from.
:::

:::warning
If you do not pass in `amount`, the transaction will be built to withdraw the full amount of the order.

```jsx
const priceWithdrawResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/priceWithdraw', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            order: "EpTsCUnKComCd8FDNZn3kVrQBQo2uEn5rRzYk9ocqFPH",
            user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
            inputOrOutput: "In", // either "In" or "Out" mint, note that price-based orders auto withdraws the output tokens to the user's wallet every time the order is executed
            amount: 1000000
        }),
    })
).json();
