:::info
Jupiter is fully supported within the Solana.Unity-SDK. The core [library](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-Core/tree/master/src/Solana.Unity.Dex) is independent of Unity and can be incorporated into Unreal Engine using the UnrealCLR library or in a C# backend.
:::

Using the Solana.Unity-SDK, game developers can effortlessly incorporate Jupiter swaps into their games and achieve cross-platform compatibility without the need to modify a single line of code.

Within the SDK, the Jupiter Payments API is also available, enabling you to utilize Jupiter + SolanaPay for facilitating user payments with any SPL token, allowing pricing in USDC or other tokens.
