Referrers are entitled to a share of referral fees, while the platform collects the remaining. The fees are collected and withheld by the program and are claimable anytime.

We are using the [Referral Program](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral) to power our platform fee. You can check out how the [Referral Program](/docs/additional-topics/referral-program) works.

## Referral Program
