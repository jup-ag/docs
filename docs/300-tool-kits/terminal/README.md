## Getting Started

When integrating Terminal, there are a few integration methods to think about, and choose the one that best fits your application's architecture and requirements.

### Integration Methods

- **Using Window Object** - Simplest way to add and initialize Terminal.
- [**Using NPM Package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/terminal) - Install via `npm install @jup-ag/terminal` and initialize as a module (will require you to maintain its dependencies).

### Wallet Integration

- **Wallet Standard Support**: For applications without existing wallet provider, Terminal will provide a wallet adapter and connection - powered by [Unified Wallet Kit](/docs/tool-kits/wallet-kit/).
- **Passthrough Wallet**: For applications with existing wallet provider(s), set `enableWalletPassthrough=true` with context, and Terminal will allow the application to pass through the existing wallet provider's connection to Terminal.

### Adding Fees to Terminal

- **Referral Account**: You can create a referral account via [scripts](/docs/ultra-api/add-fees-to-ultra) or [Referral Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag).
- **Referral Fee**: You can set the referral fee and account in the `formProps` interface when you initialize the Terminal.
