# DEX Rust Integration

To facilitate integration of your DEX with [@jup-ag/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/core) you need to provide a DEX SDK that allow us to implement the following interface:

```js
pub trait Amm {
    // Label of your Amm
    fn label(&self) -> String;
    // Identifier for your amm, should be your pool id
    fn key(&self) -> Pubkey;
    // The token mints that the pool support for swapping
    fn get_reserve_mints(&self) -> Vec<Pubkey>;
    // Related accounts to get the quote for swapping and creating ix
    fn get_accounts_to_update(&self) -> Vec<Pubkey>;
    // Picks data necessary to update it's internal state
    fn update(&mut self, accounts_map: &HashMap<Pubkey, Vec<u8>>) -> Result<()>;
    // Compute the quote from internal state
    fn quote(&self, quote_params: &QuoteParams) -> Result<Quote>;
}
```

`get_accounts_to_update` provides the necessary accounts to fetch, they are batched and cached by the Jupiter core SDK and delivered through `update` to the AMM instance, there might be multiple calls to `getQuote` using the same cache so **we do not allow any network calls** in the entire implementation.

You can refer to the implementation guide below for easier integration with Jupiter.

**Notes:**
- We need to be able to fork your SDK as we want to guarantee our users we can maintain support and fix potential bugs related to integrated DEXs
