# Getting Your Token on Jupiter

**To get your token listed**

- Your token must exist on-chain and have token metadata conforming to the [Metaplex Token Metadata](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard).
- Your token must have a minimum amount√• of liquidity of **$500** in any of the DEXes that Jupiter aggregates.
    - If your liquidity is on Openbook it must have $250 on both the buy and sell side.

Once you've met the requirements above, Jupiter will automatically list your token within a few minutes.

:::info Unknown Tokens
We are listing tokens with sufficient liquidity automatically. These tokens are marked with the 'unknown' label, to encourage users to double-check that the mint addresses are the right ones that they wish to interact with before proceeding.

Please proceed with caution -- Token names and symbols can be faked and the only source of truth is the mint address. More details are shared in this tweet:

:::tip Strict List
For the safety and convenience of users, we provide a "strict" list API, which shows a smaller set of validated tokens and is the default on our UI. See [Token List API](../apis/token-list-api) for more details. If you want to get your token on the Strict list, refer to the segment on community validation.
