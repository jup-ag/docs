Token API aims to provide accessibility to all Solana tokens that are tradable on Jupiter. The Token API is built with a tagging system which consists of tokens from [Jupiter's verification system](https://x.com/9yointern/status/1907425355071197347), LSTs and also the ability to support partner token tags.

Through the Token API, you can query by tags, mints, markets to get a list of tokens and also to get more on the token information.
