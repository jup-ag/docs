This section covers the FAQ of the API Key set up and rate limits systems. Please read [API Setup](/docs/api-setup) and [API Rate Limit](/docs/api-rate-limit) docs as well.

#### Does Lite or Ultra plan need payment?
- No, you do not need to pay for Lite or Ultra.
- For Lite, just request directly to `lite-api.jup.ag` without an API Key.
- For Ultra, you will need to log in first to generate an API Key and use it with `api.jup.ag/ultra`

#### Does Pro plan have any advantages from Lite?
- By purchasing a Pro plan, you are only accessing higher rate limits with no differences in usage nor freshness of data.

#### Can I use the same API key for all Jupiter APIs?
- Yes, API keys are universal across both Fixed Rate Limit and Dynamic Rate Limit system.

#### Does the API Key apply immeidately?
- No, it will take 2-5 minutes for it to reflect.

#### What happens if I upgrade/downgrade my plan?
- You can only upgrade/downgrade your Pro plan.
- The amount payable is pro-rated.
- Upgrade happens immediately (2 - 5 minutes) is still required to be reflected.
- Downgrade will happen at the end of the billing period if you are to renew the plan.

#### Can I use both Pro and Ultra APIs together?
- Yes. You can maintain a Pro subscription for all other API routes while integrating Ultra endpoints separately.
- Do note that purchasing a Pro plan, does not apply its rate limits to Ultra API.
