# Jupiter RFQ Webhook Toolkit

Welcome to the **Jupiter RFQ Webhook Toolkit** documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you integrate your market making system with Jupiter's Request for Quote (RFQ) module.

## What is Jupiter RFQ?

Jupiter RFQ allows market makers to provide liquidity and adjust their quotes without being subject to the volatility of on-chain gas prices or chain health. RFQ fills are much less computationally intensive (10x less) compared to AMM swaps and can save gas costs in the long run.
