There are 2 things you should note when creating a new token - ensuring your token gets **routed on Jupiter**, and getting your token **verified by the community**.

## Instant Routing for New Tokens

All markets are instantly routed for **14 days** — you can trade any token listed on any of the supported AMMs.

New tokens are marked with a **'⚠️’** label to encourage users to double-check that the mint addresses are the right ones that they wish to interact with before proceeding. The default mode on our UI shows validated tokens first, which projects can request to be on.

This encourages users to be careful, while providing them accessibility to new tokens.

## Getting Your Tokens Fully Routed on Jupiter

After **14 days**, if your token pool doesn’t fit the criteria to be fully routed on jupiter, your token will automatically be dropped from routing on jupiter.

Your pools must fit the **following criteria**:

- **Price Impact on $500**: A user should encounter less than **30%** price impact after buying and selling the token from the same pool. This ensures there is sufficient liquidity, using a position size of **$500**.
- **Price Difference**: For additional markets, on already supported tokens, there should be a variance of less than **20%** between the new pool and the pool existing in Routing. 

## Get Your Token Verified by Jupiter’s Community

You can get your token verified by the community by submitting your token for review on [catdetlist.jup.ag](http://catdetlist.jup.ag).
