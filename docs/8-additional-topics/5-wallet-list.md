# Wallets supported on Jupiter


**TLDR:**
Only wallets that are aligned with the [Wallet Standard](https://docs.phantom.app/developer-powertools/wallet-standard) will be supported going forward. You will still be able to access wallets that were previously supported on our [legacy site](https://legacy.jup.ag/).

## Why is my wallet not supported?

We are sorry if your go-to wallet is not supported. We recommend migrating to other wallet that are aligned with the [Wallet Standard](https://docs.phantom.app/developer-powertools/wallet-standard), such as Phantom, Glow, Backpack, OKX and more.

Wallets that do not conform to the latest standard have always been difficult for us to support. The challenges include:

- Not supporting Versioned Transaction, which severely impacts the routing experience and prevents us from getting you the best quote
- Unpatched security
- Abandoned development
- Unnecessary impact on user experience from large bundle sizes of unused wallets
