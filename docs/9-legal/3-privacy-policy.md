### 7. Privacy of children

Our Interface is not directed to collect any data from people under the age of 18. We do not knowingly allow anyone under 18 years old to submit any data to our Interface. If you believe your child may have provided us with their data, you can contact us using the information in this Policy and we will delete the data from our Interface.


### 8. Transfer of Personal Data

Transfers to third countries shall be made subject to appropriate safeguards, namely Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the supervisory authority and approved by the Commission. Copy of the foregoing appropriate safeguards may be obtained by you upon a prior written request sent. We may instruct you on further steps to be taken with the purpose of obtaining such a copy, including your obligation to assume confidentiality commitments in connection with being disclosed the Jupiter proprietary and personal information of third parties as well as terms of their relationships with Jupiter.

Keep in mind that the use of the Interface based on public blockchains is intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of Personal Data, in particular when blockchain data is combined with other data. Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled or operated by us, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter Personal Data from such networks.


### 9. Data Integrity & Security of Processing

We take data security very seriously. We work hard to protect the Personal Data you provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. We utilize a variety of safeguards such as encryption, digital and physical access controls, non-disclosure agreements, and other technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is at rest.

Please note that no electronic transmission, storage, or processing of Personal Data can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Data will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your Personal Data will always remain private or secure.
