## What's New?

:::caution API Gateway: Improvements
*Last updated: March 2025*

**Improved API Gateway!**

For those that have been using the new hostnames at `api.jup.ag/**`, we have made improvements to the infrastructure
- Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now
- Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits)

**Dual endpoint moving forward.**

We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via https://portal.jup.ag/
- `api.jup.ag` will serve only pro/paid users
- `lite-api.jup.ag` will be the endpoint to provide free usage

:::danger ACTION REQUIRED
**ACTION REQUIRED (only for free usage)**
- Migrate to `lite-api.jup.ag` **BY 1 MAY 2025**
- The paths remain unchanged, only domain change
- The same rate limits still apply
- You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free
- If you are still on `api.jup.ag` without an API key, you will get a 401 response

**NO action required for higher rate limit plans via Portal**
- Your usage on `api.jup.ag` remains unchanged
- You can only use `api.jup.ag` with an API Key

:::caution Trigger API: New Hostname and Breaking Changes
*Last updated: March 2025*

- The `/limit/v2` path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the `/trigger/v1` path immediately.
- `/execute` endpoint is introduced.
- `/createOrder` endpoint now includes an additional `requestId` parameter to be used with the `/execute` endpoint.
- `/cancelOrder` endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while `/cancelOrders` endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders.
- The `tx` field in the responses are now `transaction` or `transactions`.
- `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint is introduces a new format to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters).
- [Please refer to the documentation for usage](/docs/trigger-api/create-order).
