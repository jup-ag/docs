In this section, you can find the rate limiting details for the Jupiter API. The Jupiter API uses a token bucket rate limiting system that is applied on a per-account basis.

:::note API Usage
**Hostnames**

- For paid tiers with API Keys, use `api.jup.ag`
- For free tier, use `lite-api.jup.ag` (NO API Key required)

**API Key**

Simply add the API Key in the `x-api-key` field in the Headers.

```js
headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': '' // enter api key here
},
```
:::

## Per Account Setup

Using the API Keys generated from the same account will share the same rate limit.

## Token Configuration

These are the token configurations for each tier. Based on the tier, the amount of tokens allocated per periodare different.

For example, in Pro II, you will be allocated 500 tokens every 10 seconds, which is approximately 3,000 requests per minute.

| Tier | Request Per Minute | Tokens Allocated | Per Period |
|------|--------------------|------------------|------------|
| Free | 60 | 60 | 1 minute |
| Pro I | 600 | 100 | 10 seconds |
| Pro II | 3,000 | 500 | 10 seconds |
| Pro III | 6,000 | 1,000 | 10 seconds |
| Pro IV | 30,000 | 5,000 | 10 seconds |

**Buckets**

Each account has two separate token buckets and they share the same rules as stated in the table above.
1. The Default bucket is shared for all APIs except the Price API.
2. The Price API bucket is dedicated to the Price API and is separate from the Default bucket.

When you make an API request, a token is consumed from the appropriate bucket. If there are no tokens available in the bucket, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

:::note
The free tier does not have a dedicated Price API bucket, all requests will be consumed from the same Default bucket.

## Managing Rate Limits

If you receive a 429 response, you should:
1. Wait for your bucket to refill
2. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
3. Consider upgrading to a higher tier if you consistently hit rate limits

:::caution
If you decide to spam or burst more than your allocated rate limit, the initial requests will be go through but the subsequent requests will be blocked even after the minute/expected refill.
