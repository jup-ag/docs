## Building a Good Product with You 

We aim to make developing a good swap interface or program as seamless as possible to help you build world class experiences for your users.

We offer a wide range of tools to make it possible, including:

- [Swaps](/docs/apis/swap-api)
- [Payments API](/docs/apis/payments-api) to specific an exact output token amount 
- [Limit Orders](/docs/limit-order/)

For DEXes looking to integrate Jupiter, check out:
- [Jupiter Terminal](/docs/web-integration/jupiter-terminal) for the easiest way to integrate with your UI
  
For projects who wants to make your token visible on the Strict list, see:
- [Get your Token onto Jupiter](/docs/get-your-token-onto-jup)

To learn how to use Jupiter from the perspective of the user, see [User guides.](/guides)
