## Build World Class Swap Experiences Now!

Jupiter's goal is simple: Help you provide world class experiences for your users. We aim to do this with as little work as possible on your end, regardless of use case or need.

**Jupiter offers a wide range of tools to make your life easy. Some of these tools include:**

- [Swaps](/docs/APIs/swap-api): One of the Fastest Swap APIs on Solana. Simply put in your desired pairs, amount, and slippage and receive your serialized transaction from the API to execute your swap.<br/>
- [Payments API](/docs/APIs/payments-api): Quickly swap any token to USDC. Using this, you can specify an exact output token amount in any token (not just USDC).<br/>
- [Limit Orders](/docs/limit-order/): Place limit orders quickly and easily with Jupiter Limit Orders. <br/>
- [DCA](/docs/dca/): DCA into any SPL token with Jupiter's DCA program. Integrating into your use case is fast and simple!
