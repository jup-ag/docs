## Making it easy for developers

We aim to make developing a good swap interface or program as seamless as possible. We do this by:

- Removing key barriers to providing a good UX, including having clear instructions for issues like ATAs and Open Orders accounts.
- Providing various methods of accessing the swap, so all apps, dapps, and programs can use it seamlessly.
- Providing updated liquidity sources, token lists, and UX improvements as soon as possible.

If you have questions or need support, you can ask in the #developer-support channel in our discord: https://discord.gg/jup.
