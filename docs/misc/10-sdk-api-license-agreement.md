# SDK & API License Agreement

**IMPORTANT:** This Jupiter API & SDK License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you, as Licensee ("You", "Your" or "Licensee") and Block Raccoon S.A., an entity incorporated in Panama ("Jupiter," "we" or "our") and applies to your use of the Jupiter API or SDK, as defined herein, available through https://portal.jup.ag (collectively the "Service"). The Service includes an Application Programming Interface ("API") and a Software Development Kit (“SDK”), which is further discussed and defined below. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not proceed with the use of Service, the API, or the SDK.

This Agreement becomes effective as of the date you first access, download, copy or otherwise use the API or SDK ("Effective Date"). This Agreement shall continue until terminated either by us or by you. Even after termination of this Agreement, certain provisions will survive, as discussed herein. This Agreement also incorporates Jupiter`s Terms of Service link and Privacy Policy link which terms shall also govern your use of the Service. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

YOU ARE ENTERING A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT: BY COPYING, DOWNLOADING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE JUPITER API OR SDK YOU ARE EXPRESSLY AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO COPY, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR OTHERWISE USE THE JUPITER API or SDK.

The API and SDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The API and SDK is licensed to you, and its use is subject to the terms of this Agreement.

**1. Definitions​**

1.1 **"Application Programming Interfaces"** or **"API"** or **"Jupiter API"** means the back-end smart routing algorithm which facilitates the user's efficient swapping of digital assets at a variety of third party trading venues, which may include object code, software libraries, software tools, sample source code, published specifications and Documentation. Jupiter API shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.2 **"Software Development Kit"** or **"SDK"** or **"Jupiter SDK"** means the ancillary tools and resources that allow the user to utilise or integrate the API. Jupiter SDK shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.3 **"Documentation"** includes, but is not limited to programmer guides, manuals, materials, and information appropriate or necessary for use in connection with the API, and in particular shall include the Integrator Guidelines available at https://dev.jup.ag/docs/misc/integrator-guidelines.

**2. Grant of License​**

2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Jupiter hereby grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, fee-bearing, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the API or SDK during the term of this Agreement solely for the purpose of Licensee's internal development efforts to develop products or services integrating the API and/or SDK in any manner, including without limitation for any informational, comparison, or testing purpose (the **Licensee's Product**).

2.2 Licensee shall have no right to distribute, license (whether or not through multiple tiers) or otherwise transfer the API or SDK to any third party.

2.3 Notwithstanding any of the provisions herein, where the Licensee uses the API or SDK (including without limitation for any informational, comparison, or testing purpose), it shall be required to strictly label/name/characterise the API and any output of the API as “Jupiter Metis v1" and not utilise any other label, name or characteristic, in particular where the same is visible to end users of the Licensee’s Product. The Licensee accepts that it is misleading and unethical to label/name/characterise the API and any output of the API as “Jupiter” or otherwise suggest it is the same product as the service available at https://jup.ag/.

2.4 In case of potential other API or SDK use that is not prescribed by this Agreement, please write to info@jup.ag to seek written consent.

2.5 Representations. Both Parties to this Agreement are duly organized and validly existing in good standing with all requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and conduct its business as is now being conducted. The Licensee is not identified on, or engages in any transactions with any party listed on, any sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”).

2.6 By providing access to the API and the SDK, Jupiter is solely providing a back-end technical service to the Licensee which allows the Licensee to provide swap-related services to end users of the Licensee's products or services. Jupiter is not a party to any agreement for swap-related services between the Licensee, its end users, any counterparty or trading venue where swaps are performed, nor any trustee, custodian, bailee, manager, administrator or service provider in respect of any digital asset or otherwise.

2.7 Independent Contractor Relationship. The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create anything like the relationship of an employer and employee, joint venture, partnership, or joint association.

**3. Other Rights and Limitations​**

3.1 Copies. Licensee may copy the API or SDK only as necessary for the purpose of the licence hereunder.

3.2 Except as expressly authorised under this Agreement or by Jupiter in writing, the Licensee agrees it shall not (and shall not permit or authorise any other person to):

Jupiter shall be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the Licensee's Product (including without limitation any application programming interface, software development kit, logos, brand information, technical information or data or information in connection with any aspect of the Licensee's Product) for any purpose.

3.4 Third Party Software. Licensee acknowledges that effective utilization of the API and SDK may require the use of a development tool, compiler and other software and technology of third parties ("Third Party Software"). Licensee is solely responsible for procuring such Third-Party Software and technology and the necessary licenses for the use thereof. Jupiter makes no representation or warranty concerning Third Party Software and shall have no obligation or liability with respect to Third Party Software.

3.5 No right is granted to Licensee to sublicense its rights hereunder. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Jupiter and, except as expressly set forth herein, no license is granted by Jupiter under this Agreement directly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark or other intellectual property rights of Jupiter. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize Licensee to use Jupiter`s trademarks or trade names in Licensee's advertising, marketing, promotional, sales or related materials. Jupiter reserves all rights not otherwise expressly granted in this Agreement.

3.6 No assertion by Licensee. Licensee agrees not to assert any patent rights related to the API/SDK or applications developed using the API/SDK against Jupiter, Jupiter's participants, or other licensees of the API/SDK for making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing any products or technology developed using the API/SDK.

3.7 Jupiter may from time to time provide updates or upgrades to the API or SDK. Any such updates and upgrades will be performed according to Jupiter's then-current operational policies, which may include automatic updating or upgrading of API or SDK currently in use at that time. Where the Licensee fails to accept such updates or upgrades, Jupiter shall be entitled to withhold access to the API, SDK and/or Service, and the same shall not constitute any breach of the terms of this Agreement.

**4. Intellectual Property and proprietary rights**

4.1 As between Jupiter and Licensee, Jupiter and/or its licensors shall own and retain all proprietary rights, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in and to the API and SDK and any corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, improvements, or modifications thereto and (to the extent such rights accrue to the Licensee), the Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, conveys and assigns to Jupiter all of its right, title, and interest therein.

4.2 Jupiter shall have the exclusive right to apply for or register any patents, mask work rights, copyrights, and such other proprietary protections with respect thereto.

4.4 The Parties acknowledge that Jupiter does not store, send, or receive digital assets. Digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the relevant blockchain network. Any creation or transfer of title that might occur in respect of any digital asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network (on the relevant contractual terms applicable to such creation and/or transfer) and is performed by the Licensee's Product, and Jupiter does not have any role or responsibility in such transactions. Jupiter cannot guarantee that the Licensee's Product, or any party can effect the transfer of such title or right to any digital asset. Accordingly, Jupiter cannot provide any guarantee, warranty or assurance regarding the authenticity, uniqueness, originality, quality, marketability, legality or value of any digital assets utilised in connection with the API and the Services.

**5. No Obligation to Support​**

5.1 Subject to payment of fees as described herein, Jupiter would issue to the Licensee certain unique API keys, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials (collectively, **"Keys"**), for accessing the API and/or SDK and managing the Licensee's access to the API. The Licensee may only access the API with the Keys issued to the Licensee by Jupiter. The Licensee acknowledges that access to the API may not always be available. The Licensee may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose its Keys to any other party or use them for any other purpose other than that expressly permitted by Jupiter. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of the Keys. The Licensee is fully responsible for all activities that occur using the Keys, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by the Licensee or a third party. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate information (including a current email address and other required contact information) for the Licensee's access to the API and SFK. Jupiter may discontinue the Licensee's access to the API and SDK if such contact information is not up-to-date and/or the Licensee does not respond to communications directed to such coordinates.

5.2 Jupiter makes no guarantees with respect to the performance, availability or uptime of the API or the SDK.

In addition, Jupiter may change the method of access to the API, SDK and Documentation at any time.

5.3 Jupiter does not guarantee any support for the API or SDK under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to require Jupiter to provide consultations, support services or updates, upgrades, bug fixes or modifications to the API or SDK. In the event of degradation or instability of Jupiter's system or an emergency, Jupiter may, in its sole discretion, suspend access to the API and/or SDK.

5.4 Jupiter reserves the right to change the method of access to the API or SDK at any time to ensure the safety and security of its environment.

Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets. Jupiter and the Licensee will each pay their respective attorneys' fees and expenses. Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to the Licensee and Jupiter and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.
