The Jupiter Portfolio provides comprehensive portfolio tracking across the Solana ecosystem. With the Portfolio API, developers can query user positions, balances, and staking information across multiple DeFi platforms and protocols.

**BETA**

The Portfolio API is currently in beta. We are actively experimenting with the best ways to provide API access for projects and welcome feedback from developers.

## About

Jupiter Portfolio has evolved significantly over time:

* **Initial Phase**: Started as per-product history and active position tracking within individual Jupiter products
* **[Sidebar Implementation](https://x.com/SolBurq/status/1838573698116390962)**: Implemented and experimented with a unified sidebar portfolio view across Jupiter's interface
* **Comprehensive Portfolio Platform**: Introduced a standalone portfolio website and API, developed by the [Sonarwatch team, now part of Jupiter](https://x.com/jup_portfolio/status/1883079851344568582)
