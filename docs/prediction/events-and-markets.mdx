The Prediction Market API is currently in beta and subject to breaking changes as we continue to improve the product. If you have any feedback, please reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).
</Note>

This guide covers how to discover prediction market events, search for specific topics, and retrieve detailed market information including pricing data.

For conceptual background on how events, markets, and pricing work, see the [Prediction Market Overview](/docs/prediction).

## Prerequisite

To use the Prediction Market API, you'll need a free API key from the [Jupiter Portal](https://portal.jup.ag).

<Tip>
**API REFERENCE**

## List Events

Use `GET /events` to retrieve a paginated list of prediction market events. You can filter by category, provider, and status.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| `category` | string | Filter by category: `crypto`, `sports`, `politics`, `esports`, `culture`, `economics`, `tech` |
| `subcategory` | string | Filter by subcategory within the category |
| `filter` | string | Filter by status: `new`, `live`, `trending` |
| `sortBy` | string | Sort field |
| `sortDirection` | string | Sort direction: `asc` or `desc` |
| `includeMarkets` | boolean | Include nested markets in response |
| `start` | number | Pagination start index |
| `end` | number | Pagination end index |

Example: List Trending Crypto Events

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/events?' + new URLSearchParams({
    category: 'crypto',
    filter: 'trending',
    includeMarkets: 'true'
  }),
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const events = await response.json();
console.log(events);
```

## Search Events

Use `GET /events/search` to find events by keyword.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| `query` | string | Search term |
| `limit` | number | Maximum results to return |

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/events/search?' + new URLSearchParams({
    query: 'nba',
    limit: '10'
  }),
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const searchResults = await response.json();
```

---

## Get Event Details

Use `GET /events/{eventId}` to retrieve full details for a specific event, including all its markets.

```js
const eventId = 'event-123';
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/events/${eventId}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const event = await response.json();
```

---

## Get Suggested Events

Use `GET /events/suggested/{pubkey}` to get personalized event recommendations based on a user's trading history.

```js
const userPubkey = 'YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY';
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/events/suggested/${userPubkey}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const suggestedEvents = await response.json();
```

---

## Get Market Details

Use `GET /markets/{marketId}` to retrieve detailed information about a specific market, including current pricing.

<Note>
There can be multiple markets for the same event.
</Note>

```js
const marketId = 'market-456';
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/markets/${marketId}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const market = await response.json();
console.log(market);
```

Example response:

```json expandable
{
  "marketId": "market-456",
  "eventId": "event-123",
  "title": "SOL $500 by Q2 2026",
  "description": "Will Solana reach $500 USD...",
  "status": "open",
  "result": "",
  "openTime": 1704067200,
  "closeTime": 1719792000,
  "buyYesPriceUsd": "650000",
  "sellYesPriceUsd": "620000",
  "buyNoPriceUsd": "380000",
  "sellNoPriceUsd": "350000",
  "volumeUsd": "450000",
  "openInterest": "1250",
  "liquidityUsd": "85000"
}
```

### Understanding Prices

<Info>
**Prices are in native token units**

All prices in the API are denominated in native token units where **1,000,000 native token units = \$1.00**.

For example:
- `650000` = \$0.65 (650000 / 1000000 = \$0.65)
- `380000` = \$0.38 (380000 / 1000000 = \$0.38)
- `10000` = \$0.01 (10000 / 1000000 = \$0.01)
</Info>

The market response includes four price fields:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `buyYesPriceUsd` | Cost to buy a YES contract |
| `sellYesPriceUsd` | Amount received when selling a YES contract |
| `buyNoPriceUsd` | Cost to buy a NO contract |
| `sellNoPriceUsd` | Amount received when selling a NO contract |

<Tip>
**Price as Probability**

Market prices reflect the implied probability of an outcome. A `buyYesPriceUsd` of `650000` (\$0.65) suggests the market believes there's roughly a 65% chance of YES being the outcome.
</Tip>

### Market Status

| Status | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `open` | Market is actively trading |
| `closed` | Trading has stopped, awaiting settlement |
| `cancelled` | Market voided, positions returned |

### Market Result

| Result | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `""` (empty) | Market not yet resolved |
| `pending` | Resolution in progress |
| `yes` | YES outcome confirmed |
| `no` | NO outcome confirmed |

---

## Get Orderbook Data

Use `GET /orderbook/{marketId}` to retrieve the current orderbook with bid/ask depth.

The response has four arrays. Each entry is a `[price, quantity]` pair:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `yes` | YES bids: `[price_cents, quantity]`. Price is in cents (e.g. `1` = $0.01). |
| `no` | NO bids: `[price_cents, quantity]`. Same format as `yes`. |
| `yes_dollars` | YES bids with price as decimal string: `["0.0100", quantity]`. |
| `no_dollars` | NO bids with price as decimal string. Same format as `yes_dollars`. |

Quantities are in base units (e.g. contract size). Arrays are ordered by price (typically best bid first).

Example: Get orderbook data for a specific market

```js
const marketId = 'market-456';
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/orderbook/${marketId}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const orderbook = await response.json();
```

**Example response:**

```json expandable
{
  "yes": [
    [1, 346014],
    [2, 10568],
    [3, 12300]
  ],
  "no": [
    [1, 219],
    [2, 14],
    [3, 4400]
  ],
  "yes_dollars": [
    ["0.0100", 346014],
    ["0.0200", 10568],
    ["0.0300", 12300]
  ],
  "no_dollars": [
    ["0.0100", 219],
    ["0.0200", 14],
    ["0.0300", 4400]
  ]
}
```

## Check Trading Status

Use `GET /trading-status` to verify if the exchange is actively trading. This is useful for conditional logic before placing orders.

```js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.jup.ag/prediction/v1/trading-status',
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    }
  }
);

const status = await response.json();
console.log('Trading active:', status.trading_active);
```
