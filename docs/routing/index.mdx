## Juno Liquidity Engine

Juno is Jupiter's latest liquidity engine, it is built with the combined learnings from Iris and JupiterZ, with one single objective - to ensure the best possible execution price and success rate across all engines and liquidity sources. Juno employs a sophisticated self-learning mechanism to maintain high availability of competitive routes while automatically sidelining underperforming or potentially problematic quotes. Juno will be incrementally introducing new third-party liquidity sources and a continual effort to improve Iris and JupiterZ routing capabilities.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-liquidity sources** | Integrates third-party liquidity sources and Jupiter's proprietary routing engines to ensure best possible rates.      Currently, Juno consists of Iris, JupiterZ, Hashflow, DFlow and more in the pipeline. |
| **Self-learning** | Automatically detects and sidelines underperforming or problematic sources, while continuously learning to provide competitive quotes. |
| **Continuous optimizations** | By integrating external liquidity sources directly, Juno creates a competitive environment that drives continuous improvement across all routing engines. This approach ensures users consistently receive optimal execution rates while providing valuable performance data to enhance both Iris and JupiterZ routing capabilities. |

Juno is directly powering the Ultra Swap on Jupiter frontend (jup.ag) and is also accessible via [**Ultra Swap API**](/docs/ultra): The Jupiter Ultra Swap API is the *only* API you ever need to experience or build the best trading experience on Solana - Jupiter handles all the complexities such as RPCs, slippage, broadcast method and landing rates, all while accessing the best liquidity available through Juno.

## Jupiter Iris Routing Engine

<Note>
  Ultra Swap API uses Iris as its router, Legacy Swap API continues to use legacy version of Metis.
</Note>

Iris is Jupiter's latest and most advanced routing engine, purpose-built for Jupiter Ultra to deliver the best execution price across Solana's diverse liquidity landscape. This new engine reflects our deep learnings from previous iterations and is at the core of Jupiter Ultra's unmatched execution performance.

  Iris is our new router exclusive to Jupiter Ultra, our Ultra V3 blog post discusses the improvements and benefits of Iris.

Behind Iris is a proven history of innovation: Jupiter’s original DEX aggregation engine, Metis v1 (launched 2023), set the standard as a reliable, general-purpose liquidity engine for Solana. Successive updates such as Metis v1.5 (April 2025) were introduced for Ultra, and these lessons and ongoing experiments directly informed the design and capabilities of Iris, making it the next evolutionary step in Jupiter’s routing technology.

  Metis v1.5 introduced new algorithmic improvements for more granular splits and wider intermediate token support, achieving a significant reduction in quote-execution spread.

| **Overcoming SVM constraints** | Employs a sophisticated and efficient transaction construction to enable multi-hop-multi-split swaps. |
| **Integrating diverse DEXes** | Utilizes a standardized interface to integrate with a wide range of DEXes, abstracting away the complexities of each individual DEX. |
| **Optimizing for price and execution** | Ensuring the quoted price is as close as the actual price, while also ensuring the transaction is executed successfully. |
| **Accessing markets immediately and safely** | Employs necessary infrastructure powered by a network of robust RPC nodes to include markets and checks their liquidity in real-time. |

The engine integrates with most DEXes on Solana, you can find a complete list of supported DEXes via the [/swap/v1/program-id-to-label](https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/program-id-to-label) endpoint.

## JupiterZ (RFQ) Routing Engine

Since its launch in 2024, JupiterZ has emerged as a transformative addition to Jupiter's routing capabilities. JupiterZ functions as an RFQ (Request For Quote) system that connects users directly with market makers, enabling market makers to provide competitive quotes for top token pairs. This ensures users receive the best possible execution price available from both on-chain and off-chain liquidity at the moment they wish to trade.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intent-based architecture** | Employs an intent-based system where users express their desired trade and market makers compete to fulfill it. |
| **Integrating diverse market makers** | Utilizes a standardized interface to integrate with multiple market makers, abstracting away the complexities of each liquidity provider. |
| **Optimizing for price and execution** | Creates a competitive environment where market makers compete to provide the best quotes, while ensuring the transaction is executed successfully and efficiently. |
| **Real-time quote aggregation** | Employs a versatile proxy to collect and compare quotes from multiple routing sources (such as Jupiter Iris and JupiterZ) in real-time. |
| **Gasless transactions** | Enables users to execute trades without incurring transaction fees, providing a seamless and cost-effective trading experience. |

JupiterZ has been handling a large portion of trades on the Jupiter frontend (jup.ag) - which has demonstrated JupiterZ's reliability and effectiveness in providing competitive quotes and successful trade execution.

Currently, JupiterZ is accessible through the **Ultra Swap API**: A streamlined interface that makes it simple for developers and applications to tap into Iris, JupiterZ and other routing sources.
