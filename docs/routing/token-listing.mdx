Jupiter's routing engine creates routes in the perspective of markets. A token must have a market with sufficient liquidity to be tradable. This page links to resources for understanding token listing, the Tokens API, and the token verification process.

Jupiter's routing engine creates routes in the perspective of markets, if you have minted/created a token but does not have a [market created with liquidity](/docs/routing/market-listing), your token will not be tradable.
