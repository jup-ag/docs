The Jupiter Send API lets you send tokens to any user — even if they don't have a connected wallet. Recipients claim their tokens through Jupiter Mobile. The API supports crafting send transactions, managing invites, and clawback of unclaimed sends.

Send is the perfect onboarding tool to gift, pay, or onboard anyone in seconds - even if they don't have a wallet.
* Send any token - SOL, USDC or memecoins.
* Send to a new user without a wallet, existing user or anyone.
* No fees to send or claim, only network transaction fees required.
* Use Jupiter Mobile seamlessly - even if you sent non-SOL tokens, Ultra provides Gasless Support that pays for swap transaction fees.
