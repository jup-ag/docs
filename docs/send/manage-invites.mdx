<Info>
  **NOTE**

  Both of the following endpoints only returns the invites that are set up by the sender and not from the perspective of the recipient.

  * Pending invites: Invites created by the sender that are not yet expired and can be clawback/claimed.
  * Invite history: Invites created by the sender and is either claimed, clawback, or expired. (You can also pass in a Recipient pubkey to get their history)

  **TIP**

  Depending on how you have set up to allow connection of wallets, either via [Jupiter Mobile Adapter](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/jupiter-mobile-adapter) for QR code login, wallet extensions, or any other methods, you will need to handle the passing in of their pubkey to the API to get the necessary data.

  await fetch(
    `https://api.jup.ag/send/v1/pending-invites?address=${pubkey}`,

        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
      },
    }
  )
).json();
```

## Get Invite History

```js
const inviteHistory = await (
  await fetch(
    `https://api.jup.ag/send/v1/invite-history?address=${pubkey}`,
