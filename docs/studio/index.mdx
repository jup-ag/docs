## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why is my Studio token page showing 'Token not found'?">

* In order for us to track and store your token information, header image or token description, you **must** send your signed transaction from the `create_tx` endpoint to the `submit` endpoint.
* This will allow us to store your token into our database and reflect it as a Studio token on our frontend.
* If you submit the transaction on your own or some other way, the token will not have a dedicated Studio page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do with the presigned URLs?">

* Those URLs are for you to upload your token's metadata and image to a static endpoint, which will be in the token's URI metadata onchain.
* You are required to make a PUT request to those endpoints, [you can refer to this section on the usage](/docs/studio/create-token#token-metadata).
* If you do not upload your token image and metadata to this endpoint, your token will not have any image/metadata reflected onchain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the rate limit of Studio API?">

* Free usage rate limit: 100 requests per 5 minutes
* For paid rate limit: 10 requests per 10 seconds (for all Tiers)
