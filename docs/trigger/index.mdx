The Jupiter Trigger API enables you to create limit orders on Solana, allowing users to set target prices for token swaps that execute automatically when market conditions are met.

The Trigger API is ideal for:

* DeFi applications that want to offer users more advanced trading options
* Wallets looking to expand their trading features
* Automated systems that need to execute at specific price points

| jup.ag UI Mode | API Implementation            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Exact**      | `slippageBps: 0` (default)    | Orders execute with 0 slippage for precise price execution <br/> <br/> By default, trigger orders execute with 0 slippage (you can omit the `slippageBps` parameter)                                                                 |
| **Ultra**      | `slippageBps: <custom_value>` | Orders execute with custom slippage for higher success rates On the jup.ag UI, Ultra denotes that Jupiter sets the slippage for the user, however, in API implementation, you will need to evaluate and set it yourself. |
