The Jupiter Ultra Swap has 8-10x lower fees than market average, with only 5 to 10 bps of the swap amount as a fee.

## Key Points

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Default fees** | 5 to 10 bps of the swap amount |
| **Integrator fees** | Ultra takes 20% of your integrator fees |
| **Token support** | SPL and Token2022 tokens |
| **Fee mint** | Fee mint is determined by Ultra based on a [priority list](#priority-list) |

### Priority List

When requesting for an order, Ultra will decide which mint to take fees in based on a priority list. The list consists of different categories of tokens.

1. SOL - Solana!
2. Stablecoins - USDC, USDT, etc
3. Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) - JupSOL, etc
4. Bluechips - Typically large market cap tokens
5. Others - Other tokens that do not fall into the above categories

<Note>
You can use the `/order` endpoint to check for the `feeMint` and `feeBps` field directly.

Or you can use the `/fees` endpoint to check the fees and category given the input and output mint.

### Integrator Fees

To add integrator fees to Ultra Swaps, you will be required to set up referral accounts and token accounts for the specific token mints you want to collect fees in.

Refer to the [Add Integrator Fees](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide for more details on how to set up.
