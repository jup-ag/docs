To get an Ultra Swap order, you need to pass in the required parameters such as:

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `inputMint` | The input token mint address |
| `outputMint` | The output token mint address |
| `amount` | The amount of input token to swap, in native token units (before decimals) |
| `taker` | The user's wallet address (**Note:** If the `taker` is not provided, there will still be an Order Response with no `transaction` field) |
| `referralAccount` | The referral account address - refer to the [Add Fees To Ultra Swap](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide for the step by step process |
| `referralFee` | The referral fee in basis points (bps) |

```js Get Order
const orderResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/order'
        '?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112' +
        '&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v' +
        '&amount=100000000' +
        '&taker=jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3'
    )
  ).json();
```

## Order Response

In the order response, you will receive a number of fields that are important to note of, such as the `swapType`, `slippageBps`, etc.

<Note>
Refer to [API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/order) section for the full response fields.
</Note>

The main fields you should need:

* `transaction`: The base64 encoded transaction that you need to sign before submitting to the network.
* `requestId`: The request ID of the order to be used in the `Execute Order` endpoint.

Now, you are able to get a swap order, next steps is to make a post request to the `Execute Order` endpoint. [Let's go](/docs/ultra/execute-order)!
