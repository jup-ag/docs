Fetch a swap order for 1 SOL to USDC:

```js Get Order
const orderResponse = await (
  await fetch(
    'https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/order' +
    '?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112' +
    '&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v' +
    '&amount=100000000' +
    '&taker=jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3',
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
      },
    }
  )
).json();
```

## Order Response

In the order response, you will receive a number of fields that are important to note of, such as the `swapType`, `slippageBps`, etc.

<Note>
Refer to [Response](/docs/ultra/response) section for example responses.
Refer to [API Reference](/api-reference/ultra) section for the full response fields.
</Note>

The main fields you should need:

* `transaction`: The base64 encoded transaction that you need to sign before submitting to the network.
* `requestId`: The request ID of the order to be used in the `Execute Order` endpoint.

Now, you are able to get a swap order, next steps is to make a post request to the `Execute Order` endpoint. [Let's go](/docs/ultra/execute-order)!
