llmsDescription: "GET /ultra/v1/shield?mints={mints} returns token security warnings (freeze authority, mint authority, low organic activity, etc.) for specified mint addresses."
---

The `/ultra/v1/shield` endpoint returns security warnings for one or more token mint addresses. Warnings include freeze authority, mint authority, unverified status, low organic activity, and new listing alerts. Use this to inform users before they trade.

This is useful when integrating with Jupiter Ultra Swap or any other APIs, allowing you or your user to be informed of any potential malicious mints before conducting your transaction.

Check shield warnings for multiple mints:

```js
const shieldResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/shield?mints=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112,EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v,someTokenAddressForEducationalPurposes`,
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
      },
    }
  )
).json();
```

## Shield Response

The shield response will return a list of objects, containing the token information and warnings of the mints passed in.

Do note that this is subject to changes, and we will be adding more warnings and improving the accuracy of the warnings over time.

For the full list of potential warnings, refer to the [Shield API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/shield).
