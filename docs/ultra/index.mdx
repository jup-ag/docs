## Features

<Callout icon="book-open" color="#FFC107" iconType="regular">[Read our latest blog on Ultra V3](/blog/ultra-v3).</Callout>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Juno Liquidity Engine">
Ultra Swap utilizes the latest [Juno Liquidity Engine](/docs/routing) which aggregates across multiple liquidity sources, including Jupiter's proprietary routing engines: improved versions of Iris and JupiterZ, and third-party liquidity sources, for the best possible price.

It also includes self-learning capabilities (to detect and sideline low-quality liquidity sources) which creates a competitive environment for all liquidity sources to continously optimize their performance and price.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Executed Price">
Ultra Swap guarantees the best executed price through several key innovations:

* **Predictive Execution**: Ultra simulates and compares executed prices (not just quoted prices) before actually sending a transaction, dynamically selecting the route with the least slippage for real user outcomes.
* **Ultra Signaling**: Ultra provides signaling to Proprietary AMMs to help them distinguish Ultra user flow, incentivizing them to quote tighter spreads and better prices.
* **Slippage-Aware Routing**: Automatically prioritizes and selects routes that minimize realized slippage, protecting users from misleading "best quotes" that deliver poor executed results.

For detailed examples and results, see [our Ultra V3 blog post](/blog/ultra-v3#maximising-executed-price).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sub-second Transaction Landing & MEV Protection">
Ultra is now using our new in-house transaction-landing engine, Jupiter Beam, which allows us to send transactions via our own infrastructure: designed to make every trade faster, more private, and more precise.
* Leverage our own validator stake and dedicated R&D efforts.
* Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
* Eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring faster and more secure execution for our users.

Results:
* Landing Latency: Improved by 50-66% compared to our previous approach that relied on multiple providers
    * Lands in 0–1 block (~50–400ms)
    * Compared to the 1–3 blocks (~400ms–1.2s) previously.
* MEV Protection: Routing transactions through our own infrastructure provides:
    * Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
    * Reduce frontrunning exposure - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
    * Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors - [see our blog post on Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio](/blog/ultra-v3#mev-protection).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Real Time Slippage Estimator">
Building on top of our previous versions of slippage estimation/optimization engines, we have developed a new Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE), that is able to intelligently estimate the best possible slippage to use at the time of execution, balancing between trade success and price protection.

RTSE uses a variety of heuristics, algorithms and monitoring to ensure the best user experience:

* Heuristics: Token categories, historical and real-time slippage data, and more.
    * Uses token categories to intelligently estimate slippage for different token types.
    * Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
    * Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.
* Algorithms: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on slippage data, and more.
* Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of failure rates to ensure reactiveness to increase slippage when necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Gasless">
Ultra Swap provides different gasless mechanisms for different scenarios.

* Gasless via Jupiter Z (RFQ): All swaps routed via Jupiter Z are gasless, as the market maker is the fee payer for the transaction.
* Gasless via Gasless Support: Depending on the tokens and trade sizes of your swap, Ultra Swap will automatically determine if it can provide gasless support to your swap by helping you pay for the transaction fee of your swap - you can identify this via the secondary signer in the transaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API Latency">
95% of all swaps are executed under 2 seconds via our proprietary transaction sending engine.

## What About Legacy Swap API?

Ultra Swap API is the next evolution of our swap infrastructure, designed and continuously optimized to deliver the best possible trading experience on Solana. We are focused on providing a high-performance, reliable, and feature-rich API that incorporates the latest advancements and optimizations for users and integrators.

While Ultra Swap API is engineered for optimal performance and ease of integration, the Legacy Swap API remains available for developers who require advanced customization, such as:

* Adding custom instructions.
* Incorporating Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls.
* Selecting specific broadcasting strategies for signed transactions (e.g., priority fee, Jito, etc.).
* Choosing which DEXes or AMMs to route through.
* Modifying the number of accounts used in a transaction.

If your use case demands these highly custom features, the Legacy Swap API may be more suitable. However, it also requires you to manage many aspects that Ultra Swap API handles automatically, including:

* **RPC management**: Retrieving wallet balances, broadcasting, and tracking transactions.
* **Transaction fee selection**: Managing priority fees, Jito fees, and more.
* **Slippage optimization**: Determining the best slippage settings for trade success and price protection.
* **Transaction broadcasting**: Ultra Swap leverages a proprietary transaction engine for superior speed and reliability.
* **Swap result parsing**: Handling transaction polling, parsing, and error management.

For most developers and applications, Ultra Swap API is the recommended choice, as it is purpose-built and continually improved to provide the best possible swap experience on Solana.
