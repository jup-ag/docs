Jupiter makes it easier than ever to convert your local currency into crypto assets on Solana through its seamless Onramp integration.

With Onramper, Jupiter’s direct Onramp application lets you purchase Solana assets directly using your local currency. This tool aggregates the best onramp services like Stripe, Banxa, and MoonPay to provide the most competitive rates and options based on your region, amount, and payment method.

## How It Works

1. **Access the Onramp App:** Select the Onramp option at https://jup.ag/onboard/.
2. **Set Preferences:**
    - Choose your language, review terms, and find support if needed.
3. **Choose Currency & Asset:**
    - Input the amount you’d like to spend and select the Solana asset you want to purchase.
    - We recommend always buying SOL, so you can use it for transaction fees and easily swap to other assets via Jupiter for the best price.
4. **Select Payment Processor:**
    - Pick your desired processor from the list of available options.
5. **Complete the Transaction:**
    - Click "Buy" and complete the transaction on the payment processor’s secure site. A new tab will open to finalize the purchase.

:::note Fees
Jupiter **does not charge any additional fees** for Onramp transactions.

## CEX Transfers to Solana

Transferring assets to Solana has never been easier. If you are looking to transfer assets from a Centralized Exchange (CEX), each CEX may have different requirements for external transfers. Be sure to refer to their respective guides for step-by-step instructions.

Always transfer a small amount first to ensure your wallet address is correct.
