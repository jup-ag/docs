## What Are Bridges and How Do They Work?

Bridges are specialized applications that handle assets the movement of assets between chains. They act as the middlemen, ensuring your tokens travel securely from one blockchain to another. There are different types of bridges, but on the surface, they mostly work in a similar fashion.

1. **Start on the Bridge App:** Open the bridge application you plan to use.
2. **Connect Your Source Wallet:** This is the wallet that will fund your transaction.
3. **Select Tokens and Amounts:** Choose the token and amount you want to transfer from your source wallet.
4. **Connect Your Destination Wallet:** This wallet will receive your funds after the bridge process.
5. **Choose Destination Token:** Select the token you want to receive on the destination chain.
6. **Review Transaction Preview:** Check the total fees and amounts.
7. **Approve Transactions:** Confirm two separate transactions, one for the source chain and one for the destination chain.

This process ensures your assets are safely transferred, but always double-check wallet addresses and token details to avoid mishaps.
