## Understanding Wallet Security

1. **Never Disclose**
   - Seed/recovery phrase
   - Private keys
   - Any sensitive wallet information

2. **Safe Practices**
   - Only connect to trusted, verified websites
   - Verify all transaction details before signing
   - Be cautious of phishing attempts

3. **Support Channel Safety**
   - Official support is only available through our Discord server
   - Never trust direct messages claiming to be support
   - Jupiter team will never ask for your private keys or seed phrase

## Understanding Wallet Funding

Every blockchain transaction requires a small fee (paid in SOL). These fees compensate validators for processing transactions as they help maintain the Solana blockchain and process/verify transactions.
