Jupiter has integrated with Onramper to power a direct Onramp application from dirty fiat directly into the Solana asset of your choosing. 

Onramper is an on-ramp aggregator, helping users around the world get on-chain quickly and easily with the best prices. The Onramp application includes the top on-ramp services (Stripe, Banxa and Topper) to provide the best routing and options based on your region, desired amount and payment preference.

:::info
Jupiter will never charge any additional fees for using the Onramp service and Onramper is offering a reduced fee promotional period for the first six months of the integration. This reduced fee promotional period will end in December 2024.
