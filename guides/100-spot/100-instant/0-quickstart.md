Swapping tokens is a fundamental activity in the decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling users to trade from one cryptocurrency to another without relying on a centralized exchange or entity.

On Solana, where speed and efficiency are paramount, **Jupiter Swap** focuses on providing you with safety, control and accessibility to diverse tokens with the best price.

## What is a Token Swap?

A token swap allows users to exchange from one cryptocurrency to another directly, using liquidity pools on DEXs. Instead of navigating multiple platforms to find the best rates or sufficient liquidity, Jupiter streamlines this process by aggregating routes and providing users with the most efficient and cost-effective paths for their trades.

## Key Features of Jupiter Swap

Solana is designed for trading, with its incredible speed and low transaction costs fueling the creation of thousands of new tokens, markets, and groundbreaking use cases. At **Jupiter**, our mission is to be your go-to platform—the **Everyday Exchange**—offering a smooth, reliable, and fast token-swapping experience. Here’s what makes swapping with Jupiter exceptional:

### Trade with Safety

Your safety and confidence are our priorities. Jupiter helps you make informed decisions by showing essential token details and trade conditions.

- **Token Details:** View key information like metadata and authorities.
- **Filtered Search:** We automatically remove duplicate and imposter tokens while using community verification and real-time data (liquidity, volume) for smarter token searches.
- **Price Checks:** We estimate price impacts and cross check our quote prices with market prices to ensure you are notified of the trade outcome.

### Trade with Control

Whether you prefer simplicity or fine-tuned control, Jupiter has you covered:

- **Auto Mode:** Set your max slippage and enable MEV protection, and we’ll handle the rest. Jupiter optimizes transaction fees, slippage, and market conditions for a hassle-free experience.
- **Manual Mode:** For advanced users who want full control, we offer options like Fixed Slippage and Dynamic Slippage settings.

### Access to Diverse and New Tokens
    
Jupiter Swap indexes all tradable tokens on Solana, providing accessibility and exposure to trade all types of assets (bluechips, liquid-staking tokens, memes, governance tokens, etc) and opportunities.

Through **Instant Routing**, new markets on most DEXes are automatically added to Jupiter’s routing system, so you’ll always have access to the latest opportunities.
    
### Access to Best Price
    
Not all DEXs are built the same or have the same liquidity. Jupiter Swap ensures that users’ trades are routed through pools with the best liquidity at the point of quote, minimizing slippage and maximizing returns.

This is all powered by our cutting-edge algorithms, the **Metis Routing Engine:**, ensuring you get the best rates with **zero protocol fees**.
