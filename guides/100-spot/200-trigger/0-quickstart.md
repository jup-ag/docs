Trigger Order lets you buy or sell assets at a specified price, an alternative financial tool to market orders. Unlike market orders, trigger orders are not executed immediately at the current market price. They execute at a specific price at which you are willing to buy or sell.

This allows you to have more control over your price instead of being at the mercy of the market.

## What is Trigger Order?

Trigger Order is like a reliable friend, always watching out for you and acting upon your needs. Instead of monitoring market conditions and price levels then execute based on those conditions on your own, Trigger Order helps you do just that.

Here’s how it works:

- You decide how much to buy or sell.
- You also decide at what price level.
- Jupiter keeps track of your order and market rates, and automatically executes your order via Jupiter Swap (with 0% slippage) when the condition of the price level is met.

It’s simple and elegant to enter positions at your desired price level or exit positions to lock in profits.

:::note Jupiter Trigger Order is different
Jupiter Trigger Order relies on the core mechanism of Jupiter Swap to execute your orders, which means it is different from the typical central limit orderbook (if you are familiar with traditional finance or centralized exchanges).

## Key Advantages of Trigger Orders

1. **Price Control:**

    Trigger Order only executes at your desired price level. This allows you to have complete control over when the orders execute, instead of using market orders which prices can vary.

2. **Reduced Emotional Trading:**

    By planning ahead and setting predefined prices you can avoid impulse decisions based trading and stick to your plan.


## When and how to use LO Effectively

1. **When You Have a Target Price**:

    When you have a specific target price in mind and you are willing to wait. Limt order allows you to "set and forget" and automatically execute orders at your desired levels.

2. **In Volatile Markets:**

    Instead of always monitoring price movements, Trigger Order allows you to set once and let the market play out on its own, and when volatily strikes, it will automatically capitalize on the price swings.

3. **In Low Liquidity Markets:**

    In markets with low liquidity, Trigger Order ensures that you trade at favourable prices without suffering from price impacts and reducing loss of your potential profits.

## Potential Use cases

    You can catch the tokens at lower prices without needing to time the market.

2. **Selling to take profits:**

    You can take profits automatically by selling when the price hits your set target price.

3. **Range Trading:**

4. **Trading in Illiquid Markets:**

5. **Long Term Investing:**

    Investors can utilize Trigger Order to automatically accumulate assets at a target price across a longer timeframe.
