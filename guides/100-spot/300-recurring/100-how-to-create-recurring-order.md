## Step 2: Choose Your Tokens

Now it’s time to decide which tokens you want to allocate and buy.

1. Upon clicking on the token selector to choose what token to allocate and buy, the token list will open up.
2. Select the token you want to sell/allocate in the top selector, **“You’re Selling”**.
3. Select the token you want to buy in the bottom selector, **“You’re Buying”**.

:::tip **Pro Tip:**
Choose tokens that align with your investment goals. If you’re unsure, start with popular ones like SOL or LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) like JupSOL.

## Step 5: Approve the Transaction in Your Wallet

Your wallet will prompt you to approve the transaction to set up the Recurring Order.

1. Check the transaction details in your wallet.
    - The allocation amount
    - The rent for accounts
2. Approve the transaction.

Once approved, Jupiter will handle all future transactions for you automatically.

A notification toast will appear that will notify you once the transaction has been sent and has completed.
