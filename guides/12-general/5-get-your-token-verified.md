All unverified tokens are marked with a **'⚠️’** label to encourage users to double-check that the mint addresses are the right ones before trading.

If you've created a token and want to get it verified on the Jupiter Ecosystem List, you can submit your token for review on [catdetlist.jup.ag](http://catdetlist.jup.ag).

For approval, your project needs to:

- **Be at least 21 days old**
- **Have daily volume of more than 10K**
- **Have a market cap of more than 100K**
- **Have unique metadata (Symbol and Name does not duplicate another project on the community list)**
- **Have more than 500 unique holders**

:::tip Note
Your token does not have to be verified to be tradable. All new pools are supported for instant routing for **14 days** before pools get re-evaluated. Remind your users to search via your mint address so they can swap safely!
