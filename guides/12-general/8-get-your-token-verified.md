New tokens are marked with a **'⚠️’** label to encourage users to double-check that the mint addresses are the right ones that they wish to interact with before proceeding. The default mode on our UI shows verified tokens first, which projects can request to be on.

If you've created a token and want to get it verified on Jupiter, you can submit your token for review on [catdetlist.jup.ag](http://catdetlist.jup.ag).

For approval, your project needs to:

- **Be at least 21 days old**
- **Have daily volume of more than 10K**
- **Have a market cap of more than 100K**
- **Have unique metadata (Symbol and Name does not duplicate another project on the community list)**
- **Have more than 500 unique holders**

:::tip Note
Your token does not have to be verified to be tradable. All new pools are supported for instant routing for **14 days** before pools get re-evaluated. Remind your users to search via your mint address so they can swap safely!
