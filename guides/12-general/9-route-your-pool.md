To provide users access to new tokens, all new markets/pools are instantly routed for **14 days**.

After 14 days, all new markets are then re-evaluated, and markets that fit the criteria will be fully routed on Jupiter.

To get your market fully routed on Jupiter, your market must fit the **following criteria**:
- **Price Impact on $500**: A user should encounter less than **30%** price impact after buying and selling the token from the same pool. This ensures there is sufficient liquidity, using a position size of **$500**.
- **Price Difference**: For additional markets, on already supported tokens, there should be a variance of less than **20%** between the new pool and the pool existing in Routing.
