## Instant Routing for New Tokens

New tokens from Raydium, Meteora, and Orca are immediately added to Jupiter Routing. This means that newly launched tokens can be utilized across the entire Jupiter suite instantly! This includes features like DCA, Limit Orders, and Value Averaging, or simply swapping at the best prices available.



## Dynamic Slippage

Dynamic Slippage offers a seamless swapping experience. You can set a maximum slippage cap and never worry about slippage issues again. By leveraging a combination of backend liquidity computation and frontend inference, the best possible slippage rate is calculated, which is likely to pass while minimizing MEV.

## Intelligent Token Search

With the rapid growth of tokens on Solana, finding the correct token can be challenging. The token list search feature has been vastly improved, taking into account near real-time information such as liquidity, volume, community verification, and potential dubious tokens. Imposter tokens and duplicates are automatically filtered out, making the search much faster and more accurate.
