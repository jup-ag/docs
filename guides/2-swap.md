2. Next, connect your wallet by clicking the `Connect Wallet` button in the upper right corner of the site.

<!-- ![Jup Swap 6](//img/jup-swap/jup-swap6.png) -->

*Jupiter supports majority of the wallets in Solana and some Multi-chain wallets, checkout the site for the full wallet list*

3. After connecting your wallet to Jupiter, you can then select the token pairs that you want to swap from the token selector and enter the amount of tokens that you want to swap. 

4. Jupiter will find the best price routes for you amongst all the majority DEXs and AMMs in Solana, checkout the full supported list [here](/ecosystem/DEXsAMMs).

:::tip Jupiter charges no fees.
There are no protocol fees on Jupiter.  The only fees are transaction fees and exchange fees.  If you see more SOL deducted than what you expect, then, it is probably due to deposits for creating Associated Token Accounts or Serum Open Orders account. 

Fees are already factored into the # of tokens you will receive when choosing a route.
See What is price info below for more details on fees and deposits.
:::

<!-- <details open>
<summary>What is price info?</summary>

<b>Below the swap button, you will see important price information.</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Rate:</b> This will show you the price you are paying for the selected route. You can click to toggle this rate.</li>
<li><b>Within x% of CoinGecko:</b>  Jupiter will check if the rate you are getting is close to the market rate.  If the price you will pay is 2% or greater than the price on CoinGecko we will show you a warning.</li>
<li><b>Price impact:</b>  The size of your trade can also affect the rate that you get.  Price impact measure how much the size of your trade is affecting your price.  Jupiter will show a warning if it 2% or greater.</li>
<li><b>Minimum Received:</b>  This is the minimum amount of tokens you are guaranteed to received and is based on your slippage settings but also has factored in all the fees.</li>
<li><b>Fees paid to xxx:</b>  These are the exchange fees paid and there is a fee paid per hop in a route.</li>
<li><b>Transaction Fee:</b>  This is the fee you will pay for the transaction regardless if the transaction is successful or not.</li>
<li><b>Deposit:</b>  This is the rent paid to create an ATA account that will hold your token data, e.g. how much token you own. Or it is the rent paid to create a Serum OpenOrders account needed to trade on Serum.  Your deposit can be reclaimed by closing those accounts.  You can use this tool to reclaim them.</li>
</ul>
</details> -->

5. Before swapping, you can configure a few parameters before proceeding to help with your trade.
- Transaction Priority Fees
- Slippage Setting
- Swap Setting 
    - Direct Route Only
    - Use wSOL
    - Versioned Transaction

:::info What is Slippage?
This is because between the time you get a quote and the time you execute the trade the price may change.  If the price falls below your slippage rate, then the transaction will fail in order to prevent you from getting less tokens than you want.
:::

6. After you have confirmed all the parameters and inputs, you can click on the swap button, and the wallet that you have connected to Jupiter will ask you to approve the transaction to submit the order to the chain. If approve, your swap will be executed.

7. A notification toast will appear in the lower left corner that will notify user once the transaction has been sent and has completed.

8. You can view your transaction history by clicking the wallet section on the upper right of the site.
