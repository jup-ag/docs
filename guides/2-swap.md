<!-- ![Jup Swap 6](//img/jup-swap/jup-swap6.png) -->

*Jupiter supports majority of the wallets in Solana and some multi-chain wallets, checkout the site for the full wallet list*

3. After connecting your wallet to Jupiter, you can then select the token pairs that you want to swap from the token selector and enter the amount of tokens that you want to swap.

4. Jupiter will find the best price routes for you amongst all the majority DEXs and AMMs in Solana, checkout the full supported list [here](/partners).

:::tip Jupiter charges no fees.
There are no protocol fees on Jupiter.  The only fees are transaction fees and exchange fees. If you see more SOL deducted than what you expect, then, it is probably due to deposits for creating Associated Token Accounts or Serum Open Orders account.

Fees are already factored into the # of tokens you will receive when choosing a route.
:::

5. Before swapping, you can configure a few parameters before proceeding to help with your trade.
- Transaction Priority Fees
- Slippage Settings
- Swap Settings
    - Direct Route Only
    - Use wSOL
    - Versioned Transaction

:::info What is Slippage?
This is because between the time you get a quote and the time you execute the trade the price may change. If the price falls below your slippage rate, then the transaction will fail in order to prevent you from getting less tokens than you want.
:::

6. After you have confirmed all the parameters and inputs, you can click on the swap button, and the wallet that you have connected to Jupiter will ask you to approve the transaction to submit the order to the chain. If approve, your swap will be executed.

7. A notification toast will appear in the lower left corner that will notify user once the transaction has been sent and has completed.

8. You can view your transaction history by clicking the wallet section on the upper right of the site.
