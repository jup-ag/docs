## Open Order & Order History

### Open Order

Open Order section is where users keep track of submitted order/ transaction that has yet to be fulfilled.

1. **Order Info:** Order info specifies user's order from TokenA _(Selling)_ to TokenB _(Buying)_ and the amount for the order
2. **Price:** Price is the rate that is being submitted for the order - When the on-chain price of the purchase token hits, order will be executed
3. **Expiry:** Expiry period set by user when submitting the order - in this example it's `Never`, therefore order will remain active on-chain until the price hits, then order will be executed
4. **Filled Size:** Filled size is the section to monitor the fulfillment size of the order. If it is a large order, and there is insufficient liquidity on-chain, Jupiter's keeper will try to execute partially, and continue monitoring on-chain price to fulfill the rest of the order. If order is fully executed, Jupiter will send the token directly to user's wallet. There is no claiming process required
5. **Action:** Action is where user will be able to cancel and close their order/position

### Order History

Order History section is where users keep track of orders that have been completed or cancelled.

1. **Price:** Price is the rate that is being submitted for the order - when the on-chain price of the purchase token hits, order will be executed
2. **Limit Price:** Limit Price is the single unit price for the order - X amount of TokenA per TokenB
3. **Expiry:** Expiry period set by user when submitting the order - in this example it's `Never`, hence order will be on-chain until the price hits and be executed.
4. **Filled Size:** Filled size shows how much of total order size has been fulfilled
5. **Status:** Status indicates the order state - Completed / Cancelled
6. **Action - Create:** This is the first transaction that is being submitted, creating the order of trade to submit on-chain.
7. **Action - Trade:** This is the actual trade transaction being executed when the on-chain price hits the specified price submitted by user.
8. **Action - Cancel:** This is the cancellation of the order/ trade, where funds/ tokens will be refunded back to wallet
