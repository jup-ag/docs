Jupiter DCA is a dollar cost averaging solution designed to enable users to automate the purchase or sale of any SPL tokens at regular intervals over a specified period of time.

The DCA feature has some very powerful use cases, such as interacting with low liquidity markets, long term accumulation, or consistent profit taking without disrupting the market price too much. Check out this [Explainer Page](https://station.jup.ag/guides/dca/explainer) to learn more about DCA other use cases.

## Basic DCA User Flow

1. First, navigate to the [Jupiter Website](https://jup.ag/) and then click on the `DCA` icon below the top navigation bar. **Double check** that the URL in your search bar is correct: https://jup.ag/dca/
2. Next, connect your wallet by clicking the `Connect Wallet` button in the upper right corner of the site.
3. Select the token you are allocating and the token you are going to be buying on the DCA terminal.
4. Enter the amount of the token you want to allocate to the DCA orders in the amount field. 
5. Set the Frequency(Every) and the Duration(Over) for the DCA orders. 
6. Double check the Order Summary details and if things look good, click the `Start DCA` button.
7. Confirm the wallet notification and the DCA Order will be submitted to the system. 
8. A notification toast will appear in the lower left corner that will notify the user once the transaction has been sent and has completed.
9. Your new DCA will populate the Active DCAs section below the Terminal once it is confirmed and the UI updates.
10. You can expand the Active DCAs and inspect the progress of the DCA in the Overview tab, or inspect the individual orders on the Order tab.
