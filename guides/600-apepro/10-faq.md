### 1. What fees does Ape Pro charge?

A platform fee of 0.5% is applied to swap transactions. You can earn or incur lesser fees via [referrals](./referral).

### 2. I am getting failed transactions, what should I do?

It depends on what type of failed transactions, typically they are either due to insufficient funds, slippage (market volatility) or fail to land transactions (network congestion). For slippage, you can try to increase the slippage tolerance and for transaction fees, you can try to increase the max cap.
