## Token Checklist

The Token Checklist helps users reduce risks by evaluating the token’s basic fundamentals. Each metric is highlighted in Red if it poses a risk or Green if it passes the basic safety checks.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mint Authority | Shows if developers retain the ability to mint new tokens. Tokens with restricted minting capabilities are maybe safer. Green check if the Mint Authority is disabled. |
| Freeze Authority | Displays whether developers can freeze token accounts. A lack of freeze authority typically indicates higher security. Green check if the Freeze authority is disabled. |
| Liquidity Pool Burned/Locked | Indicates the percentage of the liquidity pool that has been burned or locked. A Green Check is shown if more than 50% is burned or locked. |
| Top 10 Holders | Shows the percentage of tokens held by the top 10 wallets. A Green Check appears if the top 10 holders own less than 15%, reducing the risk of price manipulation. |

There are couple of more additional metrics also available to ensure that you know more details about the token.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Dev (Developer) Address | The blockchain address associated with the token developer. |
| Dev Mints | The total number of tokens minted by the developer, helping users track potential minting abuse. |
| Info | A reminder to conduct thorough research, as meeting checklist criteria does not entirely eliminate risks. |
