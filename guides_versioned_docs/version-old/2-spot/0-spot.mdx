Welcome to **Jupiter Spot**, the most powerful way to trade tokens on Solana. 

Jupiter Spot relies on **Jupiter Routing**, a universal routing algorithm with over **22 AMMs** on Solana, intelligently finding the best prices for your trades, and across all the tokens on Solana.

Jupiter Spot is made up of 4 trading methods to help you buy and sell spot assets on Solana:
1. **Swap**
2. **Limit Order (LO)**
3. **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**
4. **Value Averaging (VA)**

Let's go through them in this overview!

**Swap between any token on Solana, with the best prices and 0 fees with a single click.**

- Jupiter also automatically minimizes [slippage](https://station.jup.ag/guides/old/jupiter-swap/how-swap-works/metropolis-features#dynamic-slippage) and set [priority fees](https://station.jup.ag/guides/old/jupiter-swap/swap#transaction-priority-fees) for you, while [flagging potential concerns](https://station.jup.ag/guides/old/jupiter-swap/how-swap-works/#safety-notifications).
- All you have to do is to set the max slippage & priority fees you are willing to pay, before swapping without worry.

  **Specify a set price to execute your trade, across most tokens on Solana.**

  - When your desired price is hit, Jupiter’s Keepers attempt to fill the order for you.
  - Note: You will get filled at exactly the rate you specified. Use our UI to help guide you in setting the right orders!

![spot-dca](/img/spot/spot-dca.png)

  **Automate regular investments with DCA, with a 0.1% fee per order.**

  - Based on your Interval (Weekly, Monthly, etc) and Number of Orders, DCA will swap on your behalf.
  - Automatically retry and minimize priority fees + slippage for DCA orders, without you needing to.

![spot-va](/img/spot/spot-va.png)

  **DCA, but price weighted. Buy more when prices are low, and buy less when prices are up.**

  - VA maintains a “target portfolio increase”, where it will buy more tokens when prices fall, and less when prices are high, instead of a fixed purchase quantity at every interval.
