The Jupiter Referral program allows you to earn fees by referring users to the platform. It uses URL parameters to track referrals: `https://jup.ag/?referrer=[ReferralKeyAddress]&feeBps=[FeesBps]`

:::info Important Notes
- ExactIn swaps support both input and output tokens.
- ExactOut swaps only support input tokens.
:::

1. Connect your wallet on Jupiter (jup.ag). 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the 'Referral' button. You'll be redirected to your referral dashboard where you can create your referral account and set up supported fee accounts (currently SOL, USDC, and USDT).

4. Create token accounts for SOL, USDC, and USDT. These cover most use cases. Ensure you have enough SOL to pay for token account rental fees

5. Once your account is set up, select your preferred fee tier (0.1%, 0.5%, or 1%). The referral mini-popup will highlight in orange any missing token accounts.
