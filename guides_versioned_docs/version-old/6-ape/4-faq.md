**Q: What are ApeProâ€™s fees?**

- **A**: ApePro charges a platform fee of 0.5% on swap transactions.

**Q: I logged in via Phantom/Solflare. Why is my Ape vault address different?**

- **A**: Your Web3 login acts like a key to generate and access your Ape vault which is an entirely separate wallet address.

**Q: Can I import an existing Phantom account into ApePro?**
- **A**: No. Refer to the [Ape Account Program](./1-overview.md#ape-account-program) to learn more.

**Q: Can I export my private key?**

- **A**: Not at the moment. ApePro uses a smart wallet program that differs from traditional wallets like Phantom. Refer to the [Ape Account Program](./1-overview.md#ape-account-program) to learn more.

**Q: How do I access my referral link?**

- **A**: *The Referral Program is currently available to a select group of early access users, public access coming soon!*
    
    Obtain your ref link via:

    - Pressing the **Share Icon** your URL from any token page. This copies your current URL (your ref ID is appended automatically).
    - Sharing your PnL flex card

**Q: What is the Safety Checklist?**

- **A**: A checklist that provides token risk assessments, including checks for `Mint Authority`, `Freeze Authority`, `LP burnt %`, `top 10 holders`, `Dev mints` and potential rug pull indicators.
