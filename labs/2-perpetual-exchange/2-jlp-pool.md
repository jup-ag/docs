description: How to Become a Liquidity Provider to the JLP Pool
---

Users have the opportunity to become Liquidity Providers (LPs) by allocating their assets or tokens into the Jupiter Liquidity Provider Pool (JLP Pool) and in return, receive 70% of the fees, compounding into the price of JLP.

### JLP - Liquidity Provider Token

JLP, the Liquidity Provider token, represents a meticulously constructed index of assets designed for swaps and leverage trading. With the integration of Jupiter Swap, you can buy and redeem JLP with any token.

The JLP Pool serves a crucial role as it supports the leveraged trading activities of the perpetual exchange. When traders seek to open leveraged positions, they will automatically borrow tokens from this pool.

As a JLP holder, you receive 70% of the fees generated by the perpetuals trading exchange. The exchange generates fees and yield in three ways:

- Opening and Closing Fees of Positions
- Borrowing Fees of Positions
- Trading Fees of the Pool

The fees are being compounded into the pool hourly.

### Risks associated with holding JLP
Main risks associated with holding JLP:

**Profit and Loss (P&L) Dynamics:** LPs are counterparties to traders, and traders' P&L impacts the JLP pool. If a trader makes a profit, the gains are sourced from the JLP pool to pay the trader. Conversely, if a trader loses money, that amount is deposited into the JLP pool for LP holders.

**Loss in one of the Indexed Token:** Like any index fund, you will experience loss if one of the indexed tokens goes down in value.

### Deposit/Withdrawal Fees

There are deposit and withdrawal fees for participating in liquidity provision for the JLP Pool. Users should consider these fees and adjust their participation amount and frequency according to their LP strategies. The deposit/withdrawal fees are designed to encourage LPs to rebalance the pool to each index assets' target weightage.For tokens that the pool has less of, deposit fees will be lower and withdrawal fees will be higher.

Upon closing their positions, if a trader wins, these gains would be taken from the JLP pool. Likewise, if a trader loses, the losses will be taken from their collateral and contributed back to the JLP pool.

A significant portion of the fees paid by traders, precisely 70%, is disbursed back to the pool. This amount is directly reinvested into the JLP, facilitating continuous compounding of yield and earnings.

:::info Overall Yield Calculations
It is essential to note that pool earnings and losses (index token appreciation/depreciation) are not factored in the overall yield calculations.

### Adding/Removing Liquidity

When an LP adds liquidity to the JLP pool, they raise the amount of liquidity in the Total Value Locked (TVL), which increases the amount tradable on the trading side.

LPs may use any token to deposit into the JLP pool. For non index tokens, the program will automatically use Jupiter swap to swap the deposited token into the token with lowest deposit fees. 

Similarly when withdrawing from the JLP pool, LPs may request to receive a different token than any of the index assets. The program will withdraw from the index asset with the lowest fees, and use Jupiter Swap to swap the withdrawn token to the LP's desired token for the best prices.

And at the point of depositing assets into JLP pool, the protocol will price in the USD value.

:::info Deposited Assets Pricing
At the point of depositing assets into JLP pool, your deposited asset will be priced in USD to calculate the amount of JLP tokens you will receive. 

For example, if you have deposited 1 SOL and at the point of deposit, market price of SOL is 50 USD, the program will base on 50 USD and transfer you 50 USD worth of JLP tokens.

#### How to Add Liquidity to JLP:

1. Begin by selecting the token asset you wish to deposit into the JLP pool from the list of token assets available in your wallet.
2. For selected tokens that belong to any of the JLP index assets (e.g. SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, or USDT), you will directly deposit your tokens and receive the JLP token. For non index tokens, the program will automatically identify the token asset in the JLP pool with the lowest fees, and swap your selected asset into that token for deposit.
3. Keep in mind that when you deposit into the JLP pool in a token that is currently more than the target weightage, higher fees will be incurred. Conversely, depositing into the pool with a token that is currently less than the target weightage, will result in lower or zero deposit fees.

#### How to Remove Liquidity from JLP:

1. Start by selecting the token asset you intend to withdraw from the JLP pool. You can choose from the list of available token assets in the pool, and the chosen asset will be withdrawn directly into your wallet.
2. For withdrawal into a token that is not any of the JLP index assets (e.g. SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, or USDT), the program will automatically identify the token asset in the JLP pool with the lowest fees (highest weightage) and withdraw from that. The withdrawn assets will then be swapped into the selected output token and transferred directly into the user's wallet.
3. Keep in mind when you withdraw from the JLP pool in a token that is currently much lower than its target weightage, higher fees will be incurred. Conversely, withdrawing from the pool in a token that is currently above its target weightage, will result in lower or zero withdrawal fees.

### Pool Target Ratio and Fees

In the JLP pool, every token holds a specific target ratio or weightage. Any deposit or withdrawal of liquidity to/from the pool will affect the current weightage of the transacted token. 

As mentioned earlier, the deposit and withdrawal fees are designed with the primary purpose of encouraging LPs to rebalance the pool to the target ratios of each index token. Higher fees are incurred for withdrawal from tokens under the target weightage (underweight token) and deposit into tokens that are over the target weightage (overweight token). The converse is true, where lower or zero fees are incurred for withdrawal from overweight tokens and deposit into underweight tokens.

Apart from the withdrawal/deposit fee mechanisms, JLP pool is also integrated into the Jupiter Routing Engine for swaps between any two tokens in the pool for rebalancing. The trade fees for swaps range between 0% and 2% based on the target ratio or weightage of the tokens.

### Fee Calculations

| Action | Fee |
|---|---|
| Opening a Position | 10 BPS |
| Closing a Position | 10 BPS |
| Swap Fee | Between 0 BPS to 200 BPS depending on pool weightage |

Fee calculation for opening and closing positions involves the volume of these transactions, multiplied by the fee percentage of 0.1%.

The borrow fee, often termed as the hourly funding fee, is computed as follows:

Hourly funding fee = (tokens borrowed / tokens in the pool) x hourly funding rate x position size

Trade fees for the pool typically range between 0% and 2%.

### APR Yield

The APY yield will get compounded into JLP so you will see JLP value increasing. Also, the current shown APY is calculated based on past week's performance and it gets updated weekly every Monday. Future APY may differ depending on all the different factors shown above.

For an estimated potential revenue, you can calculate it by taking JLP's daily or weekly total volume and multiplying it by a fee percentage. For instance:

* Total Daily Volume: 50 million
* Fee Percentage: 0.1%
* Revenue Share Percentage: 70%

Using these values, the calculation would be as follows:

Total revenue to be shared between JLP pool holders:

```
$50M x 0.1% x 70% = $35,000
```

To determine your specific share or weight in the total JLP pool, use the following formula:

```
your_pool_contributed_amount / total_pool_amount x 100 = your_pool_percentage
```

For example:

* Your contribution: $1,000
* Total pool amount: $4,000,000
* Your share percentage: 1,000 / 4,000,000 x 100 = 0.025%

Finally, you can calculate your generated revenue share by multiplying the results of the first and second calculations:

```
revenue share you generate = $35,000 x 0.025% = $8.75
```
