# Summary

We propose sUSD, a new stablecoin backed by SOL and uses leveraged LSTs as the primary yield mechanism with protocol level dynamic rebalancing for stabilty. Borrowers can mint sUSD using SOL as collateral through interest-free loans with returns from the staked leveraged SOL covering the borrowing costs while providing annualized returns of 7~20% to sUSD holders. We suggest several mechanisms to further enhance the stability and utility of sUSD, including USDC-sUSD pool and various sUSD redemption mechanisms.
