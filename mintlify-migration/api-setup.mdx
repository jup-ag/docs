## Types of Plans

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  You can always change your plans later.

  You can upgrade/downgrade your Pro plans on the UI any time.
</Info>

Depending on your needs, you can choose from the following plans:

| Plan  | Rate Limit Model                                  | Why choose this plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lite  | Free Tier                                         | You are just starting out and want to test the Jupiter APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Pro   | Fixed Tiered Rate Limits                          | Both small projects or large enterprises can utilize this with the tiered rate limits. Rate limits range from 1 RPS to 500 RPS plans.                                                                                                                                            |
| Ultra | Dynamic Rate Limits based on executed swap volume | [Using Ultra API comes with many benefits](/ultra-api) where Jupiter will handle slippage, transaction sending, and more without the need of an RPC from you. With that, the Ultra API is governed by a Dynamic Rate Limit model that will scale with your swap executions. |

## Payment

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  We are working on adding more payment methods.
</Info>

<Note>
  **PLAN RENEWAL**

  The payment is currently done on a monthly basis, which means you will need to manually renew each month.

  * 7 days before the plan expires, you will see the state change in the dashboard's table and receive an automated email as a reminder to renew.
  * Upon expiry, your key will remain valid for a grace period but will be disabled (but not deleted) when it ends.
  * The plan will be renewed to the same plan as the previous.
  * If you have any issues with the payment, [please open a ticket](https://support.jup.ag/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=18069133114012\&tf_18541841140892=api_or_developer_support).
</Note>

The current payment method we support is via Helio.

* Only Pro plans require payments.
* The payment is currently done on a monthly basis.
* The payment is done in Solana USDC only.
