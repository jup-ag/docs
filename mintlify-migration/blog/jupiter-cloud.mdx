We're excited to introduce **Jupiter Cloud** - our comprehensive new developer platform designed to empower developers building with Jupiter.

## What is Jupiter Cloud?

Jupiter powers some of the most critical and deeply integrated DeFi infrastructure on Solana, such as DEX routing and many more DeFi products. As our product ecosystem has expanded, so has the complexity of integrating with our various APIs and SDKs.

Jupiter Cloud aims to be your dedicated developer hub - consolidating all of our developer resources, APIs, SDKs, tool kits and technical deep dives into a single, streamlined experience that makes it easier than ever to integrate Jupiter's powerful DeFi infrastructure into your applications.

## Looking Forward

Looking forward, we will be continuously improving and expanding the Jupiter Cloud to support your development journey at every stage.

### Developer Documentation

As seen from this update, Jupiter Cloud has redefined our developer documentation to be more comprehensive and easier to navigate.

**Technical Resources**  
All Jupiter APIs, SDKs, and developer tools are now documented in one place with clear structure, making it easier to discover capabilities across our product suite and understand how different components work together.

**Deep Technical Insights**  
Beyond basic integration guides, the Jupiter team will be providing technical deep dives that explains the intricate architecture, design decisions, and best practices behind Jupiter's products. This helps developers not just integrate, but truly understand and optimize their implementations. Check out our first technical deep dive on [Ultra V3](/blog/ultra-v3)!

### Developer Support

As Jupiter Cloud continues to evolve and more integrations scale, we will need to meet the demand of the growing developer community. In the coming months, we will be redefining our developer support to focus on the most impactful developer needs.

**Technical Support**  
This will range from better developer community support, support for Portal enquiries and dedicated channels for growing projects and businesses - to ensure you are supported at every step of your development journey.

**Communicating Technology and Updates**  
As part of our new developer documentation, we will be utilizing the Jupiter Cloud as a platform to provide timely updates and discuss technology behind our products.

**Jupiter Portal**  
We will be improving the Jupiter Portal to be more user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus on providing more options for rate limits and support.
