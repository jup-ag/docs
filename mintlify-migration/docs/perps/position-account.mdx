title: "Position Account"
description: "This page contains an overview of the  used in the Jupiter Perpetuals Program, and specifically the  account."

The `Position` account is a struct which represents a set of parameters and states associated to trade position data for a given token.

<Info>
  **`Position` account derivation**

  The `Position` account's address is derived from the trader's wallet address / public key, the custody account, the collateral custody account, and a few other constant seeds. This means traders will always have the same Position account address for their open positions.

  This also means that traders only have nine positions available at one time:

  * Long SOL
  * Long wETH
  * Long wBTC
  * Short SOL (USDC as collateral)
  * Short SOL (USDT as collateral)
  * Short wETH (USDC as collateral)
  * Short wETH (USDT as collateral)
  * Short wBTC (USDC as collateral)
  * Short wBTC (USDT as collateral)

  This is an example [`Position` account](https://solscan.io/account/FBLzd5VM67MEKkoWerXu7Nu1ksbLXQvJDx63y5aeLEvt).
