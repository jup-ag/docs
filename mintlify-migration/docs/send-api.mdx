* Send any token - SOL, USDC or memecoins.

* No fees to send or claim, only network transaction fees required.
* Use Jupiter Mobile seamlessly - even if you sent non-SOL tokens, Ultra provides Gasless Support that pays for swap transaction fees.

## About

Send API provides more opportunities for potential users to be onboarded from other websites, apps, or any where else!

* API only supports creating Send and Clawback transactions.
* Claiming needs to be done via Jupiter Mobile only.
* You can gamify the experience post-claim once they are onboarded!

## Jupiter Mobile Adapter

To maximize users experience, once your users have claimed via Jupiter Mobile, they can use the app to continue their journey on your app or other use cases. This can be done via [Jupiter Mobile Adapter](/docs/tool-kits/mobile-adapter), allowing Jupiter Mobile users to simply use the app to scan a QR code to login, they can utilize their wallets on Jupiter Mobile across any platform.
