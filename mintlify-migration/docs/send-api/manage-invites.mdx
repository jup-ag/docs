  **NOTE**

  Both of the following endpoints only returns the invites that are set up by the sender and not from the perspective of the recipient.

  * Pending invites: Invites created by the sender that are not yet expired and can be clawback/claimed.
  * Invite history: Invites created by the sender and is either claimed, clawback, or expired. (You can also pass in a Recipient pubkey to get their history)

  **TIP**

  Depending on how you have set up to allow connection of wallets, either via [Jupiter Mobile Adapter](/docs/tool-kits/mobile-adapter) for QR code login, wallet extensions, or any other methods, you will need to handle the passing in of their pubkey to the API to get the necessary data.
