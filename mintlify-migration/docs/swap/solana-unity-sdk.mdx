Using the Solana.Unity-SDK, game developers can effortlessly incorporate Jupiter swaps into their games and achieve cross-platform compatibility without the need to modify a single line of code.

Within the SDK, the Jupiter Swap API can also be used as a [payment method](/docs/swap-api/payments-through-swap), enabling you to utilize Jupiter + SolanaPay for facilitating user payments with any SPL token, allowing pricing in USDC or other tokens.
