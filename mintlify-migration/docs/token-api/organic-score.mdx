title: "Organic Score"
description: "Organic Score is a metric designed to measure the genuine activity and health of a token. Unlike traditional metrics that can be easily manipulated by artificial trading or bot activity, the Organic Score focuses on real user participation and authentic market metrics. This helps users, developers, and projects better understand the context of similar tokens and find the signal within the noise."

## How Organic Score is Derived

Organic Score is derived from a set of core metrics, such as holder count, trading volume and liquidity. In order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the score, we track the metrics participated by real user wallets (not bots, etc) in real time to derive the Organic Score.
