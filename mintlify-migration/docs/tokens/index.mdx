## About

As Solana grew and exploded with tens of thousands of newly minted tokens a day, the Jupiter Token API and verification system has evolved to meet the demands of token verification and provide an ecosystem-wide source of truth to rely on.

A historical breakdown of the evolutions of the Token API and verification system.

* [Solana Token Registry](https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list) was deprecated in 2022.
* [Ecosystem Token List V1: Github](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list): Maintained via Github with 4.8k Pull Requests verified manually.
