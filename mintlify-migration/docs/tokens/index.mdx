## About

As Solana grew and exploded with tens of thousands of newly minted tokens a day, the Jupiter Tokens API and verification system has evolved to meet the demands of token verification and provide an ecosystem-wide source of truth to rely on.

A historical breakdown of the evolutions of the Tokens API and verification system.

* [Solana Token Registry](https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list) was deprecated in 2022.
* [Ecosystem Token List V1: Github](https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list): Maintained via Github with 4.8k Pull Requests verified manually.
* [Ecosystem Token List V2: Catdet List](https://catdetlist.jup.ag): Maintained by Catdets and community with simple metrics to aid review.
* [Ecosystem Token List V3: Verify](https://verify.jup.ag): Using a variety of trading, social metrics and [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score) to aid verification.
* [Jup.ag/verify](https://jup.ag/verify): A predecessor and evolved version of `verify.jup.ag`, where you can burn 1,000 JUP to get an express review.
