title: "Gasless Support"
description: "Key features and pointers on gasless mechanisms in Ultra Swap API."
---

The Jupiter Ultra Swap API includes **2 different gasless mechanisms** that allow users to execute swaps without directly paying network fees in SOL. This feature reduces onboarding friction and supports a smoother user experience where end-users don't need to hold SOL just to trade tokens.

## Types of Gas

1. Base network transaction fee
2. Associated Token Account (ATA) rent
3. Priority fee (or tips, etc)
4. Other accounts rent (some DEX may require additional accounts opened per user (e.g. Pumpfun))

## Gasless Coverage & Requirements

| Router | Network / Priority Fees | ATA Rent | Other Accounts Rent | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Metis** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | - Minimum trade size of 10 USD<br/>- Gas is taken from swap amount, meaning more fees taken from user |
| **JupiterZ** (RFQ) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (as of now) | ❌ Not required | - No minimum trade size<br/>- Dependent on if MM provides a quote |
| **Others** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | N/A |

## Scenario Matrix

<Warning>
Note that Metis's Gasless Support mechanism only kicks in when user has insufficient SOL.
</Warning>

| User Scenario | Metis (Gasless Support) | JupiterZ | Others |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sufficient SOL<br/>With ATA** | - User pays for gas | - MM must provide quote<br/>- MM pays for gas | - User pays for gas |
| **Sufficient SOL<br/>Without ATA** | - User pays for gas<br/>- User pays for ATA | - MM must provide quote<br/>- MM pays for gas<br/>- User pays for ATA | - User pays for gas<br/>- User pays for ATA |
| **No SOL<br/>With ATA** | - All gas covered from swap amount<br/>- Minimum trade size of 10 USD required | - MM must provide quote<br/>- MM pays for gas | - Not routed |
| **No SOL<br/>Without ATA** | - All gas and rent covered from swap amount<br/>- Minimum trade size of 10 USD required | - No quote from MM<br/>- Because user can't provide SOL for ATA | - Not routed |
| **No SOL<br/>With ATA<br/>Small swap size** | - Quote provided but no transaction<br/>- `errorCode=3` | - MM must provide quote<br/>- MM pays for gas | - Not routed |
| **No SOL<br/>Without ATA<br/>Small swap size** | - Quote provided but no transaction<br/>-`errorCode=3` | - No quote from MM<br/>- Because user can't provide SOL for ATA | - Not routed |
