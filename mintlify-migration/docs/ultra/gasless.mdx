title: "Gasless Support"
---

The Jupiter Ultra API includes **2 different** **gasless mechanism** that allows users to execute swaps without directly paying network fees in SOL. This feature reduces onboarding friction and supports a smoother user experience where end-users don‚Äôt need to hold SOL just to trade tokens.

---

## Types of Gas

1. Base network gas fees
2. Associated Token Account (ATA) gas fees
3. Priority fees (or tips, etc)
4. Other accounts (some DEX may require additional accounts opened per user (e.g. Pumpfun)

---

## Gasless Coverage & Requirements

| Router | Gasless | Network Fees | ATA Creation | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Metis** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | - Minimum trade size of 10 USD
- Gas is taken from swap amount, meaning more fees taken from user |
| **JupiterZ** (RFQ) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (as of now) | - No minimum trade size
- Dependent on if MM provides a quote |
| **Others** | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | N/A |

## Scenario Matrix

<aside>
üö®

Note that Metis‚Äôs Gasless Support mechanism only kicks in when user has insufficient SOL - it does not always apply like JupiterZ

For JupiterZ to be routable, it largely depends on the trade size and other factors as well, MMs prefer to provide quotes for larger swap sizes

</aside>

| User Scenario | Metis Router (Gasless Support) | JupiterZ Router (Gasless) | Other Routers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sufficient SOL
With ATA | - User pays for gas | - MM must provide quote
- MM pays for gas | - User pays for gas |
| Sufficient SOL
Without ATA | - User pays for gas
- User pays for ATA | - MM must provide quote
- MM pays for gas
- User pays for ATA | - User pays for gas
- User pays for ATA |
| No SOL
With ATA | - All gas covered from swap amount
- Minimum trade of 10 USD required | - MM must provide quote
- MM pays for gas | - Not routed |
| No SOL
Without ATA | - All gas covered from swap amount
- Minimum trade of 10 USD required | - No quote from MM
- Because user can‚Äôt provide SOL for ATA | - Not routed |
| No SOL
With ATA
Insufficient size | - Quote provided but no transaction
- All gas covered from swap amount
- Minimum trade of 10 USD required | - MM must provide quote
- MM pays for gas | - Not routed |
| No SOL
Without ATA
Insufficient size | - Quote provided but no transaction
- All gas covered from swap amount
- Minimum trade of 10 USD required | - No quote from MM
- Because user can‚Äôt provide SOL for ATA | - Not routed |

## Ongoing Improvements

- **Reduction of minimum trade size**
    - Currently, still requires ~50 USD and above, but will be reducing to 10 soon
- **ATA coverage is inconsistent**
    - Currently, only Metis covers ATA creation
    - JupiterZ may support ATA coverage in the future
- **Potential `payer={address}` field (refer to [Scenario Matrix for `payer={address}`](https://www.notion.so/Scenario-Matrix-for-payer-address-25d9650318e9800080a5ec28885dc7ea?pvs=21))**
    - This allows integrator to be fee payer
    - Which means gasful quotes by default can be covered by integrator as well
    - This should also take precedent over Metis‚Äôs Gasless Support
    - Integrator also must note to cover for such costs since user can drain the gas payer - ATA rent cannot be taken back, only user has authority to close and claim the SOL
        - If the extra fee needed to cover for other fee amounts to 1% of the swap - the API will return an additional 100 bps to cover
    - Limitations
        - Doesn‚Äôt work for RFQ quotes (as of now) or other routers ‚Üí our backend will handle by only providing Metis quotes
            - **What happens if you only route via Metis:**
                - Metis covers almost all swap pairs (RFQ mainly covers bluechips)
                - Metis routes through AMMs ‚Üí still prone to slippage, while RFQ is firm quotes (no slippage) - we can share more data about slippage as well, since we handle that for you/users
                - On averages: Metis handles ~50% of quotes, RFQ ~30%. RFQ only wins pricing about 5% of the time
                - Trade size diff: Metis ~$600 avg, RFQ ~$6k avg. Market makers usually prefer larger trades
                - In short, you are not losing out on much, since our own FE users are still being heavily routed via Metis and significant amount of swaps goes to long tail/meme tokens outside of RFQ's support
        - Integrator is required to proxy the request to their backend in order to sign the transaction (partially signed by user) before sending to `/execute`

---

## End-State

The ideal outcome for **Jupiter Ultra Gasless** is:

Users can **swap without ever holding SOL**, regardless of whether a new ATA is required
