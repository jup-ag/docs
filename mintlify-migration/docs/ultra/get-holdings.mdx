title: "Get Holdings"
---

The Ultra API supports a simple endpoint to get the detailed token holdings of an account, you just need to pass in the required parameter of the user's wallet address.

```js
const holdingsResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/holdings/3X2LFoTQecbpqCR7G5tL1kczqBKurjKPHhKSZrJ4wgWc`)
).json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(holdingsResponse, null, 2));
```

## Holdings Response

The holdings response will return the following:
- A list of token holdings for the user's wallet address.
- Token account information for each token holding.
- Note that the top level response outside of `tokens` is the native SOL balance.

:::tip
For tokens with more than thousands of token holdings, the response may be slow - depending on the number of token holdings, the response time may vary.

If you only need the native SOL balance, you can use `/holdings/{address}/native` to get the native SOL balance.
