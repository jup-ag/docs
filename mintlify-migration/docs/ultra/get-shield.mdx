title: "Get Shield"
---

The Ultra Swap API provides an endpoint to retrieve token information and associated warnings for the specified mint addresses. To use this endpoint, provide one or more mint addresses for the required query parameter named mints.

This is useful when integrating with Jupiter Ultra Swap or any other APIs, allowing you or your user to be informed of any potential malicious mints before conducting your transaction.

```js
const shieldResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/shield?mints=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112,EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v,someTokenAddressForEducationalPurposes`)
).json();
```

## Shield Response

The shield response will return a list of objects, containing the token information and warnings of the mints passed in.

Do note that this is subject to changes, and we will be adding more warnings and improving the accuracy of the warnings over time.

For the full list of potential warnings, refer to the [Shield API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/shield).
