<Accordion title="Juno Liquidity Engine">
Ultra Swap utilizes the latest [Juno Liquidity Engine](/routing) which aggregates across multiple liquidity sources, including Jupiter's proprietary routing engines both Metis and Jupiter Z (RFQ), and third-party liquidity sources, for the best possible price. It also includes self-learning capabilities (to detect and sideline low-quality liquidity sources) which creates a competitive environment for all liquidity sources to continously optimize their performance and price.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Sending">
Over the years of experiment and development, we have optimized and continues to better our transaction sending service. Using various strategies involving multiple RPCs, priority fees/Jito tips estimation, and more, we are able to send transactions at a blazing fast speed with a high success rate (while still being [MEV-protected](#mev-protection)).

<Note>
  95% of all swaps are executed under 2 seconds via our proprietary transaction sending engine.

  For more information on latencies, [refer to the latency section](#latency).
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MEV Protection">
According to both our internal monitoring system and external resources such as [Sandwiched.me](https://sandwiched.me/sandwiches), Ultra has the lowest incidence of MEV attacks across all existing applications, by far. Comparing using the ratio of volume to the amount of value extracted, Ultra Swap has the highest volume yet the lowest value extracted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Real Time Slippage Estimator">
Building on top of our previous versions of slippage estimation/optimization engines, we have developed a new Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE), that is able to intelligently estimate the best possible slippage to use at the time of execution, balancing between trade success and price protection. RTSE uses a variety of heuristics, algorithms and monitoring to ensure the best user experience:

* **Heuristics**: Token categories, historical and real-time slippage data, and more.
* **Algorithms**: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on slippage data, and more.
* **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of failure rates to ensure reactiveness to increase slippage when necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Gasless">
Ultra Swap provides different gasless mechanisms for different scenarios. For more information, [refer to the Gasless Support section](/docs/ultra/gasless).

* **Gasless via Jupiter Z (RFQ)**: All swaps routed via Jupiter Z are gasless, as the market maker is the fee payer for the transaction.
* **Gasless via Gasless Support**: Depending on the tokens and trade sizes of your swap, Ultra Swap will automatically determine if it can provide gasless support to your swap by helping you pay for the transaction fee of your swap - you can identify this via the secondary signer in the transaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Latency">
95% of all swaps are executed under 2 seconds via our proprietary transaction sending engine.

## What About Legacy Swap API?

Ultra Swap API is the spiritual successor to the Legacy Swap API, and is much simpler to use than Legacy Swap API. If you are first starting out on your Solana development journey, using Ultra Swap API is highly recommended over the Legacy Swap API.

However, unlike Ultra Swap API, Legacy Swap API allows developers to:

* Add custom instructions.
* Add Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls.
* Choose the broadcasting strategy for the signed transaction (ie. via priority fee, Jito, etc.).
* Choose which DEXes or AMMs to route through.
* Modify the number of accounts to use in a transaction.

If you have a highly custom need like what is described above, then Legacy Swap API may be for you. However, with Legacy Swap API, there are many more things you need to worry about that Ultra Swap API automatically handles for:

* **Upkeep of RPCs**: To retrieve wallet balances, broadcast and retrieve transactions, etc.
* **Deciding transaction fee**: Including, but not limited to, priority fee, Jito fee, etc.
* **Deciding slippage**: The optimal slippage to use to balance between trade success and price protection.
* **Broadcasting the transaction**: Ultra Swap uses a proprietary transaction sending engine which dramatically improves landing rate and speed.
* **Parsing the swap results**: Polling and parsing the resulting transaction from the RPC, including handling for success and error cases.

If the above sounds like too much work, then Ultra Swap API will be the better choice.
