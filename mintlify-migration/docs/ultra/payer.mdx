## Key Points

The Jupiter Ultra Swap API allows you to pay for networks fees and rent on behalf of your users. This feature further reduces onboarding friction as the integrator can now cover the network fees and rent for their users **without using the user's swap amount**.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Integrator payer takes precedent">
        When `payer` parameter is passed in, it **always** takes precedent over Iris's Gasless Support mechanism.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="No minimum trade size requirement">
        When `payer` parameter is passed in, it **does not** require a minimum trade size.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Network fees handling">
        Since you are paying for the network fees, you should account for the costs in your integrator fee.

        We will not incur any additional fees on top of your integrator fee (This is only for Gasless Support mechanism), which also means the `feeBps` field will always remain as what integrator pass in.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Rent costs handling">
        Since you are paying for the rent of the other required accounts, we have additional instructions to handle them.

        * **When wSOL TAs are created**, an additional transfer of SOL equal to the amount of rent paid is made to the external payer.
        * **When non-wSOL TAs are created**, the TA's [`closeAuthority`](https://solana.com/docs/tokens/basics/create-token-account) is set to be the external payer. Refer to [Close Authority](/docs/ultra/close-authority) for more details.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Expected to be used with `referral` parameters">
        When `payer` parameter is passed in, it is expected to be used with `referral` parameters such as `referralAccount` and `referralFee`.

        It is assumed that if integrator is using their own gas payer on behalf of users, they will need to recoup the costs using referral fees.

## Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Enforces routing to Iris only">
        When `payer` parameter is passed in, it will default routing to only Iris and other routers like JupiterZ will not be routed.

        (We are exploring to support JupiterZ in the future.)

        <Note>
            **What happens if you only route via Iris:**
            
            | Aspect | Note |
            |--------|------|
            | Total coverage | Iris covers almost all swap pairs (JupiterZ mainly covers bluechips). |
            | Slippage exposure | Iris routes through AMMs which is still prone to slippage, while JupiterZ provides firm quotes (no slippage).<br/><br/>Iris uses Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) to handle slippage optimizations which improves success rate by 10%. |
            | Router % | On averages: Iris handles 50% of quotes, JupiterZ 30%. JupiterZ only wins pricing about 5% of the time. |
            | Trade size coverage | Iris handles a significantly wider range of trade sizes, with 600 USD on average.<br/><br/>JupiterZ has 6,000 USD on average. Market makers usually prefer larger trades |
            
            To conclude, it is evident that most orders are still being routed via Iris and significant amount of swaps goes to long tail/meme tokens outside of JupiterZ's support. By routing to only Iris, it does not make a significant impact.

    <Accordion title="Integrator require additional backend signing for their gas payer">
        Integrator is required to proxy the request to their backend in order to sign the transaction (partially signed by user) before sending to `/execute`
