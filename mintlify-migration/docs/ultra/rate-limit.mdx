## Overview
The [**Ultra Swap API**](/docs/ultra) uses a unique rate limiting mechanism that scales with your **executed swap volume** over time.

| Property | Dynamic |
| :------- | :------ |
| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`                  |
| **Cost**                | Free to use, but Ultra Swap incurs swap fees |
| **API Key**             | Required                                     |
| **Requests Per Minute** | Base Quota + Added Quota                     |

## API Key Rules

The Ultra Swap API requires an API key to be used and can be generated via [Portal](https://portal.jup.ag).
* It is required to be used for the Dynamic Rate Limit.
* The API Key is free to generate and is universal, the API Key will work for all APIs.
* Upgrading to a Pro plan only applies to other APIs, does not work with Ultra Swap API.

## How Dynamic Rate Limit Works

Every **10 minutes**

* The system aggregates your swap volume from `/execute` on Ultra Swap for **the current rolling day** (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present).
* After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota.

| Swap Volume | Requests Per Period       | Sliding Window Period |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| $0          | 50 Base + 0 Added = 50    | 10 seconds            |
| $10,000     | 50 Base + 1 Added = 51    | 10 seconds            |
| $100,000    | 50 Base + 11 Added = 61   | 10 seconds            |
| $1,000,000  | 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 | 10 seconds            |

<Warning>
  The formula is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system.

## Managing Rate Limits

If you receive a 429 response, you should:

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests
3. **Scale your Ultra Swap usage** to unlock higher limits or reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

<Warning>
  Bursting beyond your allocation may result in **temporary 429s/rate limits**, even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.
