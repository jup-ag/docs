## Labelling

Jupiter API and SDK provides different ways to interface with our programs and products. You are advised to correctly label them.

<Warning>
    **Labelling Routers**

    When using the **`Legacy Swap API`**, you are to label the routing provider as **"Metis"**, and not "Jupiter".

    When using the **`Ultra Swap API`**, you are to correctly label each provider (provided in the `/order` API response) as they are unique, for example, if the response contains `router: iris`, you are to label it as **"Iris"**, and not "Jupiter".
