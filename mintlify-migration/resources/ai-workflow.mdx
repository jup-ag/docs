description: "How to use Jupiter docs with AI tools"
---

The Jupiter documentation is optimized for AI-assisted development through our [`llms.txt` file](/llms.txt) or [`llms-full.txt` file](/llms-full.txt), which provides a structured index of all our APIs, guides, and resources. This page shows you how to leverage AI tools effectively when building with Jupiter.

## llms.txt

A typical `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file with:

* The **site title** as an H1 heading.
* **Sections** for each major area of the docs, with links and short descriptions for each page.

Example structure:

```mdx
# Jupiter

## Docs

- [Build with Jupiter](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/index.md)
- [Get Started](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/get-started/index.md): Welcome to Jupiter’s Developer Docs. Whether you’re building your own DeFi superapp or integrating a swap into an existing application, we provide the tools and infrastructure you need to succeed.
- [Overview](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/docs/ultra/index.md): Overview of Ultra Swap and its features.
- [API Reference](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/api-reference/index.md): Overview of Jupiter API Reference
- [Jupiter Tool Kits](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/tool-kits/index.md): Powerful developer tools and SDKs that help you integrate Jupiter products into your applications with minimal effort.
- [About Routing](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/routing/index.md): The types of routing engines used in Jupiter's Swap product
- [Updates](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/updates/index.md): API Announcements and Changes
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

In addition to `llms.txt`, Jupiter also provides a [`llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) file. While `llms.txt` offers a concise, high-level index of the documentation, `llms-full.txt` contains the entire documentation site as context for AI tools - including every line description and code examples.

- **For LLMs and AI tools** that require a complete, granular map of the documentation for deep indexing or advanced search.
- **For developers** who want to see every available page and resource in one place.
- **For building custom AI workflows** that benefit from the most detailed documentation context.
