## Labelling

When integrating with Jupiter products, you are advised to correctly label the APIs used.

<Warning>
    **For Swap**

    When using the **`Ultra Swap API`**, you are to correctly label the usage as "Jupiter" or "Jupiter Ultra".
    
    When using the **`Legacy Swap API`**, you are to label the usage as **"Jupiter Legacy Swap", and not "Jupiter"**.

    When using the deprecated/no longer supported self-hosted Swap API binary, you are to label the usage as **"Legacy Jupiter Swap", and not "Jupiter"**.
</Warning>
