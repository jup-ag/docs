The [`llms.txt` file](https://llmstxt.org) is a new standard that helps large language models (LLMs) and AI tools efficiently index and understand documentation sitesâ€”similar to how a `sitemap.xml` helps search engines. By providing a structured summary of your docs, LLMs can better answer user questions and surface relevant content.

For the Jupiter documentation, an up-to-date `llms.txt` file is automatically generated and hosted at the root of the site. This file lists all available pages and sections, so AI tools can easily discover and reference our docs. No manual setup is required, but you can override it with a custom file if needed.

You can view the Jupiter docs `llms.txt` by visiting:

<Card title="llms.txt" href="/llms.txt" icon="file" horizontal>
  Open the llms.txt for Jupiter docs
</Card>

## llms.txt structure

A typical `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file with:

* The **site title** as an H1 heading.
* **Sections** for each major area of the docs, with links and short descriptions for each page.

Example structure:

```mdx
# Jupiter Developer Docs

## API Reference
- [Ultra API](https://docs.jup.ag/docs/api-reference/ultra): Reference for Jupiter's Ultra API
- [Swap API](https://docs.jup.ag/docs/api-reference/swap): Reference for Jupiter's Swap API
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.
