**WARNING**

  Please use the Discord channel for your technical questions, as it is a public channel, more people can help you and it promotes discovery/discussion.

If you open a ticket via the link that **does not relate** to Portal Enquiries, we will redirect you to the Discord channel.

</Warning>

## Customer Support

The Jupiter UI contains multiple safeguards, warnings and default settings to guide our users to trade safer. However, when you integrate with Jupiter, we cannot control these elements despite sharing best practices, hence, Jupiter is not liable for any losses incurred on your UI/platform.

The only exception is for Jupiter Ultra Swap API, where you can use our ticketing system to provide support to your users.

<Warning>
**WARNING**

  We are still in the process of finalizing the Ultra Swap API customer support process.

Reach out to [us](https://t.me/Yankee0x) to discuss what is the best way to support your users.
