Integrating multiple wallets into a single interface can be cumbersome, the Unified Wallet Kit aims to eliminates redundancies by providing these building blocks in a simple, plug-and-play package. This allows developers to focus on what matters most: building innovative features for your users.

The Unified Wallet Kit will help you reduce repetitive tasks within your development process, including:
 - Creating a wallet notification system.
 - Managing wallet states (connected, disconnected, etc.).
 - Implementing a mobile-friendly wallet connector .
