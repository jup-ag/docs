<Update label="August 2025" description="">
**SUNSETTING LEGACY ENDPOINTS**

Weâ€™re sunsetting several legacy endpoints over the next few weeks by gradually reducing access/rate limits. Please migrate to the latest versions ASAP.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* Old Quote API V6: `http://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/`
* Old Tokens API: `http://tokens.jup.ag`
* Old Price API: `http://price.jup.ag`
* Tokens V1: `http://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1`
* Price V2: `http://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2`
</Danger>
</Update>

<Update label="June 2025" description="">
**DEPRECATION OF PRICE API V2 AND TOKENS API V1**

[**Price API upgrades to V3**](/docs/price/v3) to support more reliable and timely pricing data - derived by the last swap price (across all transactions) and a set of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers.

[**Tokens API upgrades to V2**](/docs/tokens/v2) to support an easier and reliable usage with new data addition such as [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), more trading categories like toporganicscore, and more.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* If you are using **Price API V2** and **Tokens API V1**
* Please migrate to their new versions respectively
* The older versions will be deprecated by 30 September 2025
</Danger>
</Update>

<Update label="March 2025" description="">
**API GATEWAY: IMPROVEMENTS**

**Improved API Gateway!**

For those that have been using the new hostnames at `api.jup.ag/**`, we have made improvements to the infrastructure

* Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now
* Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits)

**Dual endpoint moving forward.**

We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via [https://portal.jup.ag/](https://portal.jup.ag/)

* `api.jup.ag` will serve only pro/paid users
* `lite-api.jup.ag` will be the endpoint to provide free usage

<Danger>
**Action Required (Free plan)**

* Migrate to `lite-api.jup.ag` **BY 1 MAY 2025**
* The paths remain unchanged, only domain/hostname changes
* The same rate limits still apply
* You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free
* If you are still on `api.jup.ag` without an API key, you will get a 401 response

**NO Action Required (Pro plan)**

* Your usage on `api.jup.ag` remains unchanged
* You can only use `api.jup.ag` with an API Key
</Danger>
</Update>

<Update label="March 2025" description="">
**TRIGGER API: NEW HOSTNAME AND BREAKING CHANGES**

* The `/limit/v2` path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the `/trigger/v1` path immediately.
* `/execute` endpoint is introduced.
* `/createOrder` endpoint now includes an additional `requestId` parameter to be used with the `/execute` endpoint.
* `/cancelOrder` endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while `/cancelOrders` endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders.
* The `tx` field in the responses are now `transaction` or `transactions`.
* `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint is introduces a new format to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters).
* [Please refer to the documentation for usage](/docs/trigger/create-order).
