We're excited to introduce **Jupiter Build** - our comprehensive new developer documentation platform designed to empower developers building with Jupiter.

## What is Jupiter Build?

Jupiter Build is our dedicated developer hub, now live at [build.jup.ag](https://build.jup.ag). This platform consolidates all our developer resources, APIs, SDKs, and guides into a single, streamlined experience that makes it easier than ever to integrate Jupiter's powerful DeFi infrastructure into your applications.

## Built for Developers, by Developers

Jupiter Build represents our commitment to the developer community, with a documentation experience redesigned specifically for developer workflows.

* Comprehensive API documentation covering all Jupiter APIs
* Step-by-step integration guides and best practices from our experiences
* Timely developer updates and breaking changes

We are continuously expanding coverage with new APIs, tool kits, and integration guides to support your development journey - and your feedback directly shapes our documentation priorities.

## Redefining Developer Support

As Jupiter Build continues to evolve and more integrations scale, we will need to meet the demand of the growing developer community. In the coming months, we will be redefining our developer support to focus on the most impactful developer needs.

This will range from better developer community support, support for Portal enquiries and dedicated channels for growing projects and businesses.

## Feeback
