<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Free or Ultra tier need payment?">
    * No, you do not need to pay for Free or Ultra.
    * For both, you will need to log in first to generate an API Key and use it with `api.jup.ag`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Pro tier have any advantages from Free or Ultra?">
    * By purchasing a Pro tier, you are only accessing higher rate limits with no differences in usage, data freshness and latency.
    * Though, Pro tier covers all endpoints, excluding Ultra Swap API. While Ultra Swap API has its own rate limit system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same API key for all endpoints?">
    * Yes, API keys are universal across both Fixed Rate Limit and Dynamic Rate Limit system.
    * For example, if you have purchased the pro tier, you can still use the same API Key for Ultra Swap API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the API Key apply immediately?">
    * No, it will take 2-5 minutes for it to be reflected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I upgrade/downgrade my tier?">
    * You can only upgrade/downgrade your Pro tier.
    * The amount payable is pro-rated.
    * Upgrade happens immediately, but it is still required to be reflected.
    * Downgrade will happen at the end of the billing period if you are to renew the tier.

    Refer to [Payment Method](/portal/payment) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both Pro and Ultra endpoints together?">
    * Yes. You can maintain a Pro subscription for all other API routes while integrating Ultra endpoints separately.
    * Do note that purchasing a Pro tier, does not apply its rate limits to Ultra Swap API.
  </Accordion>
