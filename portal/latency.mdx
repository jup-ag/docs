Jupiter's API operates through a distributed gateway infrastructure across multiple AWS regions. This page covers factors affecting latency, supported regions (us-east-1, us-east-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1), and tips for optimizing response times by collocating your servers.

<Warning>
`lite-api.jup.ag` will be deprecated on 31st January 2026.

## Overview

Jupiter API operates through a distributed API gateway infrastructure to provide optimal performance across different geographic regions. The APIs are exclusively HTTP-based, with self-hosted API binary protocols no longer supported.

**Key Factors Affecting Latency:**

* **Geographic Location**: Latency varies significantly based on your server's proximity to Jupiter's API gateways
* **Network Conditions**: Internet routing and congestion can impact response times
* **Request Complexity**: Different endpoints have different processing requirements

## API Gateway Latency

There are no significant differences or no penalty/benefits between the different tiers.

## Regional Distribution

Jupiter's API gateway is distributed across multiple AWS regions.

### Supported AWS Regions

| AWS Region Code | Location | Recommended For |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|
| `us-east-1` | N. Virginia | North America East Coast |
| `us-east-2` | Ohio | North America Central |
| `eu-central-1` | Frankfurt | Central Europe |
| `eu-west-1` | Ireland | Western Europe |
| `ap-southeast-1` | Singapore | Southeast Asia |
| `ap-northeast-1` | Tokyo | Northeast Asia |

## Latency Optimization Tips

### Server Collocation

**Recommended**: Deploy your servers in the same AWS regions as Jupiter's API gateways for optimal performance.

### Request Simplification

* Simplify your API requests to reduce processing time
* Avoid unnecessary parameters or complex queries
* Use the most direct endpoint for your use case

## Troubleshooting High Latency

If you're experiencing higher than expected latency:

1. **Check your server location** - Ensure you're in a supported AWS region.
2. **Monitor network conditions** - Check for routing issues or congestion.
3. **Log your requests** - Monitor request timing to identify where latency bottlenecks occur. Log both request initiation and response times to pinpoint whether delays are from network transit, API processing, or client-side handling.
