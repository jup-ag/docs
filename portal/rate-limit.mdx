<Warning>
`lite-api.jup.ag` will be deprecated on 31st January 2026.

[Refer to migration guide for more details](/portal/migrate-from-lite-api).
</Warning>

## Overview

<Card title="Fixed Rate Limit">
  Applies To: Free & Pro Tiers
  
  * Public &amp; documented Jupiter APIs are free to use via the free tier.
  * Purchasing a Pro plan only increases your rate limit.
  * Free and Pro tiers have the same usage data freshness and latency.
</Card>

<Card title="Dynamic Rate Limit">
  Applies To: Ultra Swap API (Ultra Tier)
  
  * Ultra Swap API uses a unique dynamic rate limit system.
  * [Read more about Dynamic Rate Limit](/portal/rate-limit#dynamic-rate-limit).
</Card>

## Rate Limit Rules

API Keys are universal across both Fixed Rate Limit and Dynamic Rate Limit system.

  * You can use the same API Key for all endpoints.
    * For example, if you have purchased the pro tier, you can still use the same API Key for Ultra Swap API.
  * Rate limits apply on a per account basis, not to individual API keys.
    * Generating more than 1 API key does not increase your rate limits, since they are depleting the same rate limit.

## Fixed Rate Limit

The Fixed Rate Limit system applies to the Free and Pro plans (does not include Ultra Swap API), using the sliding window method to enforce request quotas.

| Property                | Free                       | Pro                           |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/`      | `https://api.jup.ag/`         |
| **Cost**                | Free                       | Paid per month, based on tier |
| **API Key**             | Required                   | Required                      |
| **Requests Per Minute** | 60                         | Based on tier                 |
| **Window**              | 60 seconds                 | 10 seconds                    |

**Rate Limit**

Rate limits are defined over 10-second windows (except free tier at 60-second window). For example, if your tier allows 100 requests per 10 seconds, any more within that window will receive a 429 response, regardless of how few you used in the previous window.

| Tier    | Est. Requests per Minute | Requests Per Period | Sliding Window Period |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Free    | 60                       | 60                  | 60 seconds            |
| Pro I   | \~600                    | 100                 | 10 seconds            |
| Pro II  | \~3,000                  | 500                 | 10 seconds            |
| Pro III | \~6,000                  | 1,000               | 10 seconds            |
| Pro IV  | \~30,000                 | 5,000               | 10 seconds            |

Requests are distributed to each bucket:

1. **Price API Bucket** – dedicated for `/price/v3/` only - separate from Default Bucket.
2. **Studio API Bucket** – dedicated for `/studio/` only - separate from Default Bucket.
    * Free: 100 requests per 5 minutes
    * Pro: 10 requests per 10 seconds (for all tiers)
3. **Default Bucket** – used for all APIs except the Price API and Studio API.

<Info>
  * Each bucket enforces its own sliding window independently.
  * For example, Pro II = 500 per 10 seconds to the Default Bucket and 500 per 10 seconds to the Price API Bucket.
  * Free users do not have a separate Price API Bucket — all requests are counted against the Default Bucket.
</Info>

## Dynamic Rate Limit

<Note>
  Dynamic Rate Limit is currently in BETA.

  * The rate limit is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system.
  * If you find that the rate limit is too restrictive, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).
</Note>

The [**Ultra Swap API**](/docs/ultra) uses a unique rate limiting mechanism that scales with your **executed swap volume** over time.

| Property                | Dynamic                                 |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`             |
| **Cost**                | Free to use, but Ultra incurs swap fees |
| **API Key**             | Required                                |
| **Requests Per Minute** | Base Quota + Added Quota                |

### How Dynamic Rate Limit Works

Every **10 minutes**

* The system aggregates your swap volume from `/execute` on Ultra for **the current rolling day** (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present).
* After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota.

| Swap Volume | Requests Per Period       | Sliding Window Period |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| $0          | 50 Base + 0 Added = 50    | 10 seconds            |
| $10,000     | 50 Base + 1 Added = 51    | 10 seconds            |
| $100,000    | 50 Base + 11 Added = 61   | 10 seconds            |
| $1,000,000  | 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 | 10 seconds            |

## Managing Rate Limits

If you receive a 429 response, you should:

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests
3. **Upgrade your tier (Pro)** or **scale your Ultra usage** to unlock higher limits.

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  Bursting beyond your allocation may result in **temporary 429s/rate limits**, even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.
</Warning>
