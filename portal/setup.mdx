      1. Choose a plan (1 RPS to 500 RPS plans)
      2. Pay via **Helio (USDC on Solana manual renewal)**
      3. Or via **Coinflow (credit card subscription)**

    <Card title="Ultra" icon="3" horizontal>
      For all types of projects, Ultra Swap API uses a Dynamic Rate Limit model that scales with your swap executions.

      1. Generate an API key
      2. Use the API key with the base URL `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`

      <Tip>
        [Using Ultra Swap API comes with many benefits](/docs/ultra) where Jupiter handles the entire end-to-end execution without the need of an RPC from you.
