description: "How to use Jupiter docs with AI tools"
---

The Jupiter documentation is optimized for AI-assisted development through our [`llms.txt` file](https://dev.jup.ag/llms.txt) or [`llms-full.txt` file](https://dev.jup.ag/llms-full.txt), which provides a structured index of all our APIs, guides, and resources. This page shows you how to leverage AI tools effectively when building with Jupiter.

## llms.txt

A typical `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file with:

* The **site title** as an H1 heading.
* **Sections** for each major area of the docs, with links and short descriptions for each page.

Example structure:

```mdx

## Docs

- [Build with Jupiter](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/index.md)
- [Get Started](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/get-started/index.md): Welcome to Jupiter’s Developer Docs. Whether you’re building your own DeFi superapp or integrating a swap into an existing application, we provide the tools and infrastructure you need to succeed.
- [Overview](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/docs/ultra/index.md): Overview of Ultra Swap and its features.
- [API Reference](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/api-reference/index.md): Overview of Jupiter API Reference
- [Jupiter Tool Kits](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/tool-kits/index.md): Powerful developer tools and SDKs that help you integrate Jupiter products into your applications with minimal effort.
- [About Routing](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/docs/routing/index.md): The types of routing engines used in Jupiter's Swap product
- [Updates](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/updates/index.md): API Announcements and Changes
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

In addition to `llms.txt`, Jupiter also provides a [`llms-full.txt`](https://dev.jup.ag/llms-full.txt) file. While `llms.txt` offers a concise, high-level index of the documentation, `llms-full.txt` contains the entire documentation site as context for AI tools - including every line description and code examples.

- **For LLMs and AI tools** that require a complete, granular map of the documentation for deep indexing or advanced search.
- **For developers** who want to see every available page and resource in one place.
- **For building custom AI workflows** that benefit from the most detailed documentation context.

## Claude Code MCP


Claude Code MCP connects Claude to developer tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Adding the Jupiter Docs MCP enables Claude to query our docs and OpenAPI in-context, prefill API requests, scaffold sample calls, and debug errors against the real specification. This reduces context switching, speeds up integrations, and turns natural‑language prompts into executable workflows directly in your editor.

```bash
claude mcp add jupiter --transport http --scope user
```
