Jupiter Start: Educate is a program designed to allow Jupiter qualified traders and users to learn more about great projects in the Solana Ecosystem.

Each education campaign is expected to run for at least one week. During this time, the featured project will be showcased on our main site ([jup.ag](http://jup.ag/)) as well as our social media platforms *([Twitter](https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup))*.

To participate, projects should meet the following requirements:

- Introduce themselves in the [Jupiter Start: Community Introduction](../2-jupiter-start/1-community-intro.md) and obtain attestation from community members.

- Provide write-ups for the Educate page.

- Specify 2-3 on-chain tasks/actions for users to complete. These tasks need to be trackable and verifiable.

- Specify the duration of the education campaign.

- Specify the exact dates for the campaign.

- Specify the allocation of tokens/points for distribution during the campaign.

On the Jupiter side, we will provide:

- A list of qualified traders/users based on certain criteria.

- Banners featuring the project on our main site ([jup.ag](http://jup.ag/)) and social media platforms (Twitter & Discord).

- Co-marketing efforts to spread the word.
