<Update label="October 2025" description="">

## Ultra V3
We're excited to introduce Ultra V3, featuring major improvements on quoting and swap execution for the Ultra Swap API.  
* [Read the full technical deep dive in the Jupiter Developer Blog](/blog/ultra-v3).
* **IronJup - Sub-Second Transaction Landing**: Transaction sending infrastructure helps reduce landing time by 50-66% compared to traditional methods and significantly reduces MEV opportunities.
* **Just-In-Time Simulation to Verify Executable Price**: Rank quotes from multiple routers based on executable price by simulating quotes on-chain to verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
* **Just-In-Time Market Revival**: Dynamically re-indexes markets to enable tradability for all tokens.
* **Reduce Pre-Graduation Quote Latency**: Optimized pre-graduated bonding curve markets routing logic by skipping multi-route aggregation to improve quote latency from 200ms to 10ms - a 90% improvement.
* **Slippage Optimization**: Automatically prioritize slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes and increase volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.
* **Gasless Support Coverage**: Expanded coverage to Token2022 tokens, memecoin-to-memecoin swaps (when liquidity permits), and reduced minimum trade size to ~$10 USD.
* **[Try Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra)**: Ultra V3 features are live in the Ultra Swap API V1, try it and let us know your feedback!

## Jupiter Aggregator V6 Program Update
* 4 new instruction types are introduced:
    * `route_v2`
    * `exact_out_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_exact_out_route_v2`
* You can find the details in the latest IDL: [Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4#programIdl).
* V1 instructions will continue to be valid and usable.
* This enables:
    * Collect fees when the swap pair consists of a Token2022 mint.
    * Set fee beyond the previous cap of 255 bps.

## Integrator Fee
**Ultra Swap API**
* Integrator fee for Ultra now supports Token2022 tokens.
* No additional parameters are required, simply create Token2022 referral token accounts for your referral account.
* You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Ultra Swap](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide.

**Legacy Swap API**
* Integrator fee for Legacy Swap now supports Token2022 tokens.
* New [`instructionVersion` parameter](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/swap/quote#parameter-instruction-version) is introduced to the Legacy Swap API's Quote endpoint to support the new instruction types.
* To collect fees in Token2022 tokens, create Token2022 token accounts and pass in via `feeAccount`.
* You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Swap](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap) guide.

## Sunsetting Legacy Endpoints

We’re sunsetting several legacy endpoints over the next few weeks by gradually reducing access/rate limits. Please migrate to the latest versions ASAP.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* Old Quote API V6: `http://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/`
* Old Tokens API: `http://tokens.jup.ag`
* Old Price API: `http://price.jup.ag`
* Tokens V1: `http://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1`
* Price V2: `http://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2`
</Danger>

<Update label="June 2025" description="">
## Deprecation of Price API V2 and Tokens API V1

[**Price API upgrades to V3**](/docs/price/v3) to support more reliable and timely pricing data - derived by the last swap price (across all transactions) and a set of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers.

[**Tokens API upgrades to V2**](/docs/tokens/v2) to support an easier and reliable usage with new data addition such as [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), more trading categories like toporganicscore, and more.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* If you are using **Price API V2** and **Tokens API V1**
* Please migrate to their new versions respectively
* The older versions will be deprecated by 30 September 2025
</Danger>

<Update label="March 2025" description="">
## API Gateway: Improvements

**Improved API Gateway!**

For those that have been using the new hostnames at `api.jup.ag/**`, we have made improvements to the infrastructure

* Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now
* Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits)

**Dual endpoint moving forward.**

We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via [https://portal.jup.ag/](https://portal.jup.ag/)

* `api.jup.ag` will serve only pro/paid users
* `lite-api.jup.ag` will be the endpoint to provide free usage

<Danger>
**Action Required (Free plan)**

* Migrate to `lite-api.jup.ag` **BY 1 MAY 2025**
* The paths remain unchanged, only domain/hostname changes
* The same rate limits still apply
* You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free
* If you are still on `api.jup.ag` without an API key, you will get a 401 response

**NO Action Required (Pro plan)**

* Your usage on `api.jup.ag` remains unchanged
* You can only use `api.jup.ag` with an API Key
</Danger>

## Trigger API: New Hostname and Breaking Changes

* The `/limit/v2` path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the `/trigger/v1` path immediately.
* `/execute` endpoint is introduced.
* `/createOrder` endpoint now includes an additional `requestId` parameter to be used with the `/execute` endpoint.
* `/cancelOrder` endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while `/cancelOrders` endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders.
* The `tx` field in the responses are now `transaction` or `transactions`.
* `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint is introduces a new format to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters).
* [Please refer to the documentation for usage](/docs/trigger/create-order).

<Accordion title="Path Changes">
| Old Paths | New Paths |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/limit/v2/createOrder` | `/trigger/v1/createOrder` |
| `/limit/v2/executeOrder` | `/trigger/v1/executeOrder` |
| `/limit/v2/cancelOrder` | `/trigger/v1/cancelOrder`   `/trigger/v1/cancelOrders` |

## API Gateway: New Hostnames and API Keys

* API will now be served through new hostnames.
* API will now be served through API keys.
* API Keys will be distributed via [https://portal.jup.ag](https://portal.jup.ag) (Refer to [API Setup](/portal/setup) to get started).
* Old hostnames will be slowly phased out.
* Old hostnames during this period will have reduced rate limits to facilitate migration to the new API.
