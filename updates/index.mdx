* This will take effect on 31st January 2026.
* Please migrate to the API URL `api.jup.ag`.
* The paths remain unchanged, only domain/hostname changes.
* Generate an API key for free at [https://portal.jup.ag](https://portal.jup.ag).

**Action Required**
* **For free users**: Migrate to `api.jup.ag` **and use with an API key**.
* **For paid users**: No action is required.
* **For Ultra users**: If you are using `lite-api.jup.ag/ultra`, please migrate to `api.jup.ag/ultra` and use with an API key.

* [Tweet announcement](https://x.com/jupiterexchange/status/1990479870502031424?s=46)

**Breaking Changes**
* Migrated self-hosted binary to https://metis.builders

### Ultra API

### Deprecate `ctLikes` and `smartCtLikes` response field in search endpoint
* We'll be deprecating the `ctLikes` and `smartCtLikes` response field in the search endpoints.
* This will take effect next week and it affects the search endpoints in Ultra API.
* If you are using the field for any purpose, please move off and stop using it.

---

### Tokens API

### Deprecate `ctLikes` and `smartCtLikes` response field in search endpoint
* We'll be deprecating the `ctLikes` and `smartCtLikes` response field in the search endpoints.
* This will take effect next week and it affects the search endpoints in Tokens API.
* If you are using the field for any purpose, please move off and stop using it.

---

## Metis Swap API

### `routePlan[].percent` may return null
* The `routePlan[].percent` field in the Metis Swap API quote response may return `null` - due to an an upgrade on the routing algorithm.
* Please update your code to handle null values for this field.
* This change will affect `instructionVersion=V2` only and has taken effect.
* [npm package version 6.0.47](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/api/v/6.0.47) 
  has been released with the latest schema.

### Deprecate `feeAmount` and `feeMint` fields in `SwapInfo`
* We will be deprecating the `feeAmount` and `feeMint` fields from the `routePlan[].swapInfo` schema in a quote response.
* Since `outAmount` already factor in these fees.
* These fees are related to each AMM's own fee, not to any Jupiter or platform fees you may add.
* To smooth the migration, we will just show `0` for `feeAmount` and the input mint as the `feeMint`.
* Refer to [`SwapInfo` API Reference](/api-reference/swap/quote#response-route-plan-swap-info) for more details.
* [npm package version 6.0.47](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/api/v/6.0.47) 
  has been released with the latest schema.

### `nativeDestinationAccount`
* We've added a new parameter to the Metis Swap API that lets you send native SOL 
  directly to any account.
* This is similar to `destinationTokenAccount`, but instead of receiving 
  WSOL in a token account, you receive native SOL in a regular account.
* Refer to [`nativeDestinationAccount` API Reference](/api-reference/swap/swap#body-native-destination-account) 
  for more details.  
* [npm package version 6.0.46](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/api/v/6.0.46) 
  has been released with the latest schema.

<Update label="October 2025" description="">

## Ultra V3
We're excited to introduce Ultra V3, featuring major improvements on quoting 
and swap execution for the Ultra Swap API.  

* [Read the full technical deep dive in the Jupiter Developers Blog](/blog/ultra-v3).

* **Improved Routers in Meta Aggregation**: Granular splitting of 0.01%; and began usage 
of Golden-section and Brent's method for routing algorithms.

* **Ultra Signaling for Tighter Prop AMM Quotes**: Ultra signals to Prop AMMs, allowing 
them to confidently provide tighter quotes by distinguishing Ultra trades as "non-toxic" 
order flow from other "toxic" order flow - 3 bps tighter (50% better) quotes for our Ultra 
users compared to other platforms.

* **Predictive Execution to Simulate Executable Price & Potential Slippage**: Simulates routes 
on-chain to verify executable price versus quote and predict potential slippage to select the 
route with the least overall incurred slippage at the time of execution.

* **Jupiter Beam: Sub-Second Transaction Landing & MEV Protection**: Transaction sending 
infrastructure helps reduce landing time by 50-66% compared to traditional methods and 
significantly reduces MEV opportunities by 34x.

* **Real-Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) Optimizations**: Automatically prioritize 
slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes and increase volatility 
sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

* **Gasless Support Coverage**: Expanded gasless support coverage to Token2022 tokens, 
memecoin-to-memecoin swaps (when liquidity permits), and reduced minimum trade size to ~$10 USD.

* **Just-In-Time Market Revival**: Dynamically re-indexes markets to enable tradability for all tokens.

* **Reduce Pre-Graduation Quote Latency**: Optimized pre-graduated bonding curve markets routing logic 
by skipping multi-route aggregation to improve quote latency from 200ms to 10ms - a 90% improvement.

* **[Try Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra)**: Ultra V3 features are live in the Ultra Swap API V1, try it and let us know your feedback!

## Jupiter Aggregator V6 Program Update
* 4 new instruction types are introduced:
    * `route_v2`
    * `exact_out_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_exact_out_route_v2`
* You can find the details in the latest IDL: [Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4#programIdl).
* V1 instructions will continue to be valid and usable.
* This enables:
    * Collect fees when the swap pair consists of a Token2022 mint.
    * Set fee beyond the previous cap of 255 bps.

## Integrator Fee
**Ultra Swap API**
* Integrator fee for Ultra now supports Token2022 tokens.
* No additional parameters are required, simply create Token2022 referral token accounts for your referral account.
* You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Ultra Swap](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide.

**Metis Swap API**
* Integrator fee for Metis Swap now supports Token2022 tokens.
* New [`instructionVersion` parameter](/api-reference/swap/quote#parameter-instruction-version) is introduced to the Metis Swap API's Quote endpoint to support the new instruction types.
* To collect fees in Token2022 tokens, create Token2022 token accounts and pass in via `feeAccount`.
* You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Swap](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap) guide.

## Sunsetting Legacy Endpoints

We’re sunsetting several legacy endpoints over the next few weeks by gradually reducing access/rate limits. Please migrate to the latest versions ASAP.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* Old Quote API V6: `http://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/`
* Old Tokens API: `http://tokens.jup.ag`
* Old Price API: `http://price.jup.ag`
* Tokens V1: `http://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1`

<Update label="June 2025" description="">
## Deprecation of Price API V2 and Tokens API V1

[**Price API upgrades to V3**](/docs/price/v3) to support more reliable and timely pricing data - derived by the last swap price (across all transactions) and a set of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers.

[**Tokens API upgrades to V2**](/docs/tokens/v2) to support an easier and reliable usage with new data addition such as [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), more trading categories like toporganicscore, and more.

<Danger>
**Action Required**
* If you are using **Price API V2** and **Tokens API V1**
* Please migrate to their new versions respectively
* The older versions will be deprecated by 30 September 2025
</Danger>

<Update label="March 2025" description="">
## API Gateway: Improvements

**Improved API Gateway!**

For those that have been using the new hostnames at `api.jup.ag/**`, we have made improvements to the infrastructure

* Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now
* Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits)

**Dual endpoint moving forward.**

We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via [https://portal.jup.ag/](https://portal.jup.ag/)

* `api.jup.ag` will serve only pro/paid users
* `lite-api.jup.ag` will be the endpoint to provide free usage

<Danger>
**Action Required (Free plan)**

* Migrate to `lite-api.jup.ag` **BY 1 MAY 2025**
* The paths remain unchanged, only domain/hostname changes
* The same rate limits still apply
* You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free
* If you are still on `api.jup.ag` without an API key, you will get a 401 response

**NO Action Required (Pro plan)**

* Your usage on `api.jup.ag` remains unchanged
* You can only use `api.jup.ag` with an API Key
</Danger>
